Okay, now there's a Bible story that teaches the law of averages. It's an interesting story called the parable of the sower. Parable of the sower, the story of the sower. And if you haven't read it for a while, it's an interesting, very interesting story to read. It's a great illustration of the law of averages, the parable of the sower. The sower in the ancient days was the guy that planted the crops. They called him the sower. Right? They got the ground ready. I don't know just how they all got it already, right? But they got the ground ready. And this guy called the sower was the planter of the crops. And he would take a bag of seed, walk across the field, and he would, right, sow the seed and plant the crops. They called him the sower. Now the story of the sower is a typical story of life and people and results and what you can expect. Right? And then you let the obvious be your best teacher. Now when you read the story of the sower, you'll come up with some interesting points. First, the sower was a wise man. And when you read the whole story, you'll come to the conclusion the sower was a wise man, which is a high advantage. You don't want to send a dummy out to plant. Right? We will all starve come fall. Next point of the story was the sower had excellent seed. Excellent seed. The story says he had the best. He didn't settle for something cheap and second best. Third point of the story, he was highly ambitious. And when you read the whole story, you'll come to the conclusion this man was ambitious, which is an admirable quality. Ambition. And then he went to work. The guy says, oh, I knew there was a hitch in here somewhere. That's where it is probably. Right? The guy goes to work. Now the story with the sower, with the excellent seed, highly ambitious, opportunity all around him. He has the capacity. He's got the seed. Everything's ready. And he starts out to sow to get some results. Now it's an interesting story about what happened to him. It's a typical story of life, but it's fascinating. Here's what it says. He starts out to sow the seed early in the morning, but the first part of the seed that he sows falls by the wayside and the birds get it. He's sowing this good seed. Highly ambitious man sowing this good seed and the birds are grabbing it. He sows some more and the birds grab that. He sows some more and the birds grab that. Now remember, this is a typical story of life and people. Now is that fairly typical? See, I got to tell you as a leader, the birds are going to get some of the seed. You get ahold of John. Let's say you're in real estate, right? Somebody here is in real estate. You get ahold of John. John says, hey, I'm looking for a change. I need a new occupation change. And I've heard about real estate. You say, John, come on over Friday night. We're going to have this orientation class and we'll show you how to do it. Might be the new life for you. Earn the money you want to earn. Get your life turned around. Who knows what will happen? John says, sounds great to me. I'll be there on Friday night. Learn all about it. I'll probably be one of your best sales. Say, okay, see you Friday night. Now come Friday night, 730. It's supposed to start. John's not there. Say, well, maybe the traffic's a little heavy. So we wait till quarter to eight. About eight o'clock, we come to the conclusion. But the next thing 

we know is he's not going to show. Question. What's happened since this unique conversation that you had with John and you dropped on him this great idea? You've got the explanation. Helped change his life. He said he would agree to be there and he's not there. What's probably happened between then and Friday night? The birds done got the boy. Got him. And who knows who the heck it might be, right? Maybe it's his brother-in-law. Says real estate. You're not going to mix up in that, are you? Talked him out of it. Or his plumber. Says, let me tell you about real estate. His plumber. Now if you get the message back as to what happened, see, here's where you might get off track. There's a couple of things you can do when the birds are grabbing the seed. One is you can chase birds. Say, those dirty birds. And away you go after the birds. You say, where did I get ahold of his brother-in-law? I'll straighten him out. Tear him a new page. What does he know about real estate? His plumber. Now see, you're off trying to straighten things out rather than accepting it as it is. The best study of life is how it is. Not how you wish it to be. Not how you wish to rearrange it. How to take advantage of how it is. Some people would rather get even than to get ahead. 

They get off course. See, if you're off chasing birds, you have left the field. You're not sowing anymore. Now your chances go down instead of up. There's some things you don't try to cure. There's some things you ignore. Here's what it said this wise sower did. It said he ignored the birds and he kept on sowing. How clever. There's some things you just got to accept. That's the way it is. So he keeps on sowing. And here's the key. If you keep sowing, you can sow more than the birds can get. But the birds are part of life. And don't press me why. I didn't arrange all this. I don't know. It's just the way it is. So he keeps on sowing. Now the story says this sower keeps on sowing. Now the seed falls on shallow ground. Rocky ground where the soil is shallow. And it says the little plant starts to grow this time. The birds didn't get it. But the first hot day these little plants wither and die. Now that's kind of disappointing, isn't it? But see, that's bound to happen. This time you recruit John. John says I'll be one of your best. He doesn't show up at the third meeting. You say where's John? I don't know. Somebody said boo. When I went to high school, 

there were 400 and some in the, no, yes, there were 400 and some in the freshman class. And 

150 in the graduate class. Is that unusual? See, there's always more freshmen than seniors. 

What's that called? The law of averages. Life takes its inevitable toll. Everybody should stay and finish, right? Maybe they should, but they don't. And you've got to learn to 

take that into stride. See, otherwise you'll be bent out of shape. You'll be tipped over. You'll be frustrated. You will misread life and you won't know what's happening. You've just got to understand sometimes the seed falls on shallow ground. And it didn't say what to do about the shallow ground. It just said that's the way it is. And we have a tendency to say I thought sure John it'd last a month. But sure enough, it's happened. Now you're 

going to be disappointed. Let me put this in here. When this doesn't work out, you know, just as you've planned, you're going to be disappointed. But here's what you must learn to do as a leader. Learn to discipline your disappointment. That's very important. Because sometimes it's easy to say, well, Pete, he's quit. John, he's quit. I guess I'll quit. And you just follow instead of lead. You're going to be disappointed. So be disappointed, but don't let it kid you. And don't let it stack up. Just understand that's the way it is. I wish you would have stayed, but I wish him the best wherever he's going. It didn't last. But so what? That's life. Now then, here's what it said the wise sower did. He kept on sowing. How clever. Now it says the seed falls on thorny ground and the little plant starts to grow, but then the thorns choke it to death. Now, is that fairly typical? See the thorns are going to get some. The little Bible story called the thorns, the cares of life, little cares, little duties that cheat people out of big opportunities. And it happens every day. And I don't know what to do about it. I called John up and I said, John, where were you last night? We had a meeting. John says, well, I can't make every meeting. I said, why not? John says, well, I got a lot of other things I got to do. I say, what are they? You won't believe the list John gave me for last night. The backyard fence was sagging and the dogs are about to get out. You just can't let your dogs run loose. The screen door had come off the hinges. You just can't let things fall apart. You got to take time and keep things fixed up. Some extra trash had piled up in the garage. You just can't let mounds of trash take over. You got to take time and haul out this stuff on the phone. I can hear the thorns getting in the way. People letting little things cheat them out of big opportunities. Some people have the incredible ability to 

major in minor things. I drive through this little community. John's out there mowing his lawn. Cussing Luigi's face is red and he's about to explode. I stop and I get out of the car. I say, John, what are you doing? He says, what does it look like I'm doing? I say, John, there's all kinds of little neighborhood boys around here mowing your lawn. He says, they want $5. I mow it myself. I mow it myself. Number one, there should be a law against 

cheating some little neighborhood boy out of $5. That should be a law. But see, the biggest cheat is letting little things cheat you out of major opportunities. It's called the thorns that cares. But now what do you do about that? Well, see, I used to give classes on how not to let the thorns see, but that won't work. I mean, those classes won't help. 

Here's what it said this wise man. He kept on sowing. How clever. He kept on sowing. 

He understood the law of averages. Keep sowing. Good people are not trained. They're found. 

You don't need much training, right, with good people. Find good people. Now, it says finally the seed falls on good ground. That's what it says. Good. Somebody says, how do you find the good ground? Answer, keep looking. You'll recognize it when it comes by. You 

won't have to make something bad into something good. You'll recognize good when it comes by. Now, even the good ground, the story says, part of the good ground produced 30 percent, part of it produced 60 percent, and part of it produced 100 percent. Even the good ground. What's that called? The law of averages. The ratios. Where do they work? Everywhere. Who 

for? Everybody. Now, what you must do is understand the ratios as a leader so that you learn how to work with them and not against them. Now, see, I used to give classes here on how to do 100 percent, but see, that won't help. It's called frustration for the leader. In the evening seminar, I say, the key to management is don't send your ducks to Eagle School. This is part of it here. It's learning where, what to do, and how to find the right people. What to do and how to find the right people. See, that's major. So, you let people who want to produce 30, they make a contribution to the whole and the 60 and the 100. Now, here's the key question. How do you find the 100 percenters? Answer. You've got to go through the birds. You've got to go through the hot weather getting some. You've got to go through the shallow rocky soil. You've got to talk to the 30 people, the 60 people to find you the 100. Here's what we say. If you want a lot of seniors, you must load the freshman class. Okay. That's how you find seniors. You just load the freshman class. And there's 

a lot of things. You just watch the process. You don't try to change the process. You just share the story and watch what happens. Share the opportunity and watch. And you pick by watching what happens. You don't force, you don't make, and you don't change. You watch. So it's called act and share and watch and pick. Okay. Act and share and watch and pick. And what's smart is to pick 100 percenters that become 100 percenters. Right? You look 

like a hero. And you don't try to make 100 percenters out of people who are not going to do very much. And see, that's not on them. Now, some people in one enterprise are going to do much better, you know, in one enterprise than they are in another. But whatever enterprise you've got going or whatever you're working with in the way of people, just understand the law of averages. And here's the key. Don't try to change it. Learn to work with it. Okay. Is that helpful? The law of averages. I'm telling you, it'll save you a lot of heartache. It'll save you a lot of mistakes and a lot of errors and a lot of wondering and a lot of pondering, sleepless nights, agony. I mean, it just cures a whole lot of things. Once you understand the law of averages.
