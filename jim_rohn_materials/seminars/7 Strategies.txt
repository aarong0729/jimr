Up until then my life had been embarrassingly typical of

of the Snake River. When I left home I was filled with the hope
of carving for myself a good-sized chunk of the American

was ambitious, [ was very sincere about my desire to succeed,
and 1 did work hard. Success was assured!

```
Or so | thought
```
```
When T turned twenty-five, 1 had been working for six
years, soldecided to take stock of my progress. I had anagging
Suspicion that things weren't going quite right. My weekly
paycheck amounted to a grand total of fifty-seven dollars.^1
was far behind in my promises and even further behind with
the growing pile of bills strewn across our rickety kitchen table.
By now I was a father saddled with ever-growing respon-
sibilities for my expanding family. But most of all I realized
that gradually I had settled into quietly accepting my meager
ot
Tn a moment of honesty^1 began to sce that rather than
making progress^1 was falling further behind financially with
each passing day. Something clearly had to change... but
what?
Maybe hard work alone doesn't do it, I thought o myself.
This, for me, was a shocking realization, raised as^1 was to
believe that reward comes to those who carn their living by the
sweat of their brow.
But it was plain as day that although 1 was “sweatin’
plenty,” 1 was on my way to ending up at age sixty like 5o
many people I saw around me: broke and in need of assistance
“This terrified me. I couldn’t face that kind of future. Not
i this, the richest country in the world!
Still, T had more questions than answers. What should |
do? How could I change the direction of my life?
1 thought about going back to school. Only one year of
college docsn’t look good on a job application. But with a
family to look after, going back (0 school seemed impractical.
“Then I thought about starting a business. Now that was an
exciting option! But, of course, [ didn'thave the needed capital.
```
```
The Day Thas Turned My Life Around.
```
```
Afier all, money was one of my biggest problems; I always had
far too much month left over at the end of the money. (Have
you ever been in that position?)
```
```
One day, I lost ten dollars. It upset me so much that I felt
physically illfor two weeks — over a ten-dollar bill!
One of my friends tried to cheer me up. “Look, Jim,” he
said, “maybe some poor soul who needed it found it.”
But believe m, that did ot cheer me up. As far as | was
concerned 1 was the person who needed to find ten dollars, not
Jose it. (I must admit that at that time in my life benevolence
had not yet seized me.)
So that's where 1 was at age twenty-five — behind on my
dreams without a clue as to how to change my life forthe better.
```
```
“Then one day good fortune came my way. Why did it appear
atthis point in my life? Why do good things happen when they
do? 1 really don’t know. For me, this is part of the mystery of
life
Anyway, my good fortune came when 1 met a man — a
very special person by the name of Earl Shoaf. 1 first saw him
at a sales conference where he was conducting a seminar. |
cannot tell you what he said that evening that captivated me
S0, but 1 can still remember thinking to myself that | would
give anything to be like him.
At the end of the seminar it took all the courage I could
muster 1o just walk up to him and introduce myself. But in
spite of my fumbling, he must have scen my desire o succeed.
He was kind and generous and eventually took a liking to me.
A few months later he hired me to join his sales organization.
```
```
For the next five years I learned many of ife's essons from
Mr. Shoaff. He treated me like a son, spending hours teaching
me his personal philosophy, which I now call the Seven Strat-
egies for Wealth and Happiness.
```
```

```

The Day That Turned My Life Around

```
Then one day, at age forty-nine, and without any warning,
Mr. Shoaff died.
After mourning the loss of my mentor,^1 took some time
10 assess the impact he’d had on my life. T realized that the best
thing I'd received from him was not a job or even the oppor-
tunity to grow from a sales traince to executive vice-president
of his company. Rather, it was what I'd learned from the wis-
dom of his philosophy of life and his fundamentals for suc-
cessful Tiving: how to be wealthy, how to be happy.
```
```
During the next few years [ incorporated his ideas into my
life.... and^1 prospered. In fact, | made a great deal of money.
But the most gratifying experience was sharing those ideas
with my business associates and employees. The response was
enthusiastic and the results immediate and measurable.
Although I saw myself as primarily a busincssman and not
as an author or speaker,^1 felt drawn to the challenge of com-
‘municating to others, simply and dircctly, those ideas that make
a difference in how a person’s lfe turns out.

```
Five Key Words

```
All the ideas in this book stem from a group of key words.
To understand this book, therefore, and to receive maximum
value from its contents, it is essential that we reach agreement
on the meaning of each one.
```
```
* FUNDAMENTALS *
```
```
First, let’s take a look at the word *fundamentals. I define
fundamentals as those basic principles on which all accom-
plishment is buil
Fundamentals form the beginning, the basis and the reality
from which everything else flows.
1t's a contradiction of terms to talk about rew fundamentals.
Tha's Tike someone claiming to have manufactured new an-
tiques. One would be suspicious, right? No, fundamental prin-
ciples belong to the ages. They have been the same from
biblical times and will continue to remain so until the end of
time.
Let's use the word “fundamentals™ and apply it to the con-
cept of success. If you are looking for fundamental success,
thekind of success that lasts, that s built on a solid foundation,
then you should avoid exotic answers. And believe me, there

are lots of exotic answers being offered these days, especially
in southern California where I live.
Soin spite of rumors to the contrary, success is a simple
process. It doesn’t fall out of the sky. It is neither magical nor
mysterious.
```
```
SUCCESS IS NO MORE THAN THE NATURAL CON-
SEQUENCE OF CONSISTENTLY APPLYING THE FUN-
DAMENTALS OF SUCCESS TO LIFE.
```
```
The same is true of happiness and wealth. They, too, are
o more than the natural consequence of consistently applying
the fundamentals of happincss and wealth (o life
The key is 10 stick to the fundamentals.
```
```
A Half-Dozen Things
```
```
Mr. Shoaff, my mentor, said to me one day, *Jim, there
are always a half-dozen things that make cighty percent of the
difference.”
A half-dozen things... what a key thought.
Whether we are working to improve our health, wealth,
personal achievement, or professional enterprise, the differ-
ence between triumphant success or bitter failure lies in the
degree of our commitment to sek out, study. and apply those
half-dozen things.
For cxample, for a farmer (o reap a plentiful harvest in the
fall, the half-dozen basics he must concentrate on are fairly
obvious: soil, seed, water, sunshine, nourishment, and care.
Each component is of equal importance because only fogether
do they bring to fruition a successful harvest.
Thus, a good question to ask before undertaking any new
project or setting new objectives is this: WHAT ARE THE
HALF-DOZEN THINGS THAT WILL MAKE THE MOST
```
```
s
```
```
Five Key Words
```
```
DIFFERENCE TO THE OUTCOME? Whether the enterprise
i in the fine arts or in music, mathematics or physics, sports
or business, it those half-dozen fundamentals that count.
‘The understanding and application of this simple principle
is the first intelligent sicp toward accomplishing your dreams
and objectives.
```
```
* WEALTH *
```
```
The second key word to define is wealth. Wealthis a con-
troversial word because it brings to mind a wide variety of
images and sometimes conflicting concepts. After all, each of
us views wealth from a different perspective. To one person,
wealth may mean having enough money to do whatever he o
she wishes. To another, it may mean freedom from debt —
freedom from the constant claim of obligation. To yet another,
it may mean the opportunity to grow and to achieve.
But out of this diversity comes creativity, and creativity can
help each of us find unique ways to work for a life of
abundance.
“To the majority who probably haven’t spent too much time
thinking about the subject, wealth is simply symbolized by one
word: millionaire. Now there’s an exciting word! It rings of
success, freedom, power, influence. pleasure, possibility, and
benevolence. Surely, being a millionaire is not a bad mental
image to hold!
Likewise, the word wealth embodies mor than economic
concepts. One can talk of the wealth of experience, the wealth
of friendship, the wealth of love, the wealth of family, and the
wealth of culture.
However, for our purposes here, we shall focus on the kind
of wealth that brings with it financial freedom — WEALTH
THAT COMES FROM THE CONVERSION OF EFFORT
AND ENTERPRISE INTO CURRENCY AND EQUITY.
```
```

```

Five Key Words

```
For each of us, the specific amount required for us to feel
wealthy will differ. Yet I'm sure that our basic dream is the
same: o be free of financial pressures, to have freedom
of
choice, and t0 enjoy the opportunity to create and to share.
```
```
What does wealth mean to you? How much money will it
take for you to feel financially free? These are not idle ques-
tions. As you'll soon see, the more clearly defined your
con-
cepts about material wealth are, the more useful the ideas in
this book will be to you.
```
```
* HAPPINESS *
```
```
Happiness embraces the universal quest. I’ a joy that usu-
ally accompanies positive activity.
Like wealth, however, it, t00, has a variety of often con-
tradictory meanings. IU’s both the joy of discovery and the joy
of knowing. It ofien accompanies those who are fully aware
of the colors, sounds, and harmony of lfe.
And it the joy that comes to those who painstakingly
design their lives and then live them with artistry.
Happiness is the skill of reacting (0 the offerings of ife by
perception and by enjoyment
165 achieved by both giving and receiving, reaping and
bestowing. It's being able to feast on harmony as well as food,
on ideas as well as bread.
Happiness comes o those who deliberately expand their
horizons and experiences.
It resides in the houses of those who have the ability to
handle disappointment without losing their sense of well-
being. It belongs to those who are in control of both their
circumstances and their emotions.
```

Happiness is alsa the freedom from the negative children
of fear such as worry, low self-esteem, envy, greed, resent-
‘ment, prejudice, and hatred.
“Those who experience happiness often have a grasp on and
an awareness of the tremendously positive power of life and
love.
But happiness is more than a general feeling. It is also a
method of thinking that organizes feelings, activities, and lfe-
style. In other words, it's a way of interpreting the world and
its evens.
Happiness is having values in balance. IU's contentment
with daily tasks, including those unpleasant chores from which
few of us are free
Happiness is a life well-lived and filled with people of
substance. 1ts a wide variety of experiences and memories
that become priceless forms of currency to spend and to invest.
Happiness is activity with purpose. It love in practice. It's
both a grasp of the obvious and an awe of the mysterious.
Yet most of us think of happiness as something either lost
in the past or a peak to be arrived at in some distant future (I'll
be happy as soon as... ). Few understand that happiness can
only be experienced in the now. And, yes, like all good things,
happiness is often elusive. But 1 promise you that it is nor
impossible to capture.
So how does one laich onto the bluebird of happincss?
Curiously, by understanding and applying a concept which is
rarely associated with happiness... discipline.
```
```
* DISCIPLINE *
```
```
If there is one critical ingredient for your successful quest
for both wealth and happiness, it is discipline. And yet when
it comes to this concept, most people reject it as they conjure
```

Five Key Words

```
images of everything from a tough drill sergeant to a strict
schoolteacher waving a ruler.
Yet 1assure you that the acquisition of discipline holds the
key to your dreams and aspirations. Surprised? Then perhaps
we should take a moment to define what is meant by discipline.
```
```
Discipline is the bridge between thought and accomplish-
ment... the glue that binds inspiration to achievement...
the magic that turns financial necessity into the creation of an
inspired work of art.
Discipline comes to those with the awareness that for a ke
to fly it must rise against the wind; that all good things are
achieved by those who are willing to swim upstream; that drift-
ing aimlessly through life only leads to bitterness and
disappointment.
Discipline is the foundation on which all success s bult
Lack of discipline inevitably leads to failure.
Yet, curiously, many do notassociate lack of discipline with
lack of success. Most people envision failure as one earth-
shattering event, such as a company going bankrupt or ahouse
being repossessed.
“This, however, is not how failure happens. Failure s rarely
the result of some isolated event. Rather, it is a consequence
of a long fist of accumulated little failures which happen as a
result of too little discipline.
Failure occurs cach time we fail to think... foday, act

1f your goal requires that today you write ten letters and
you write only three, you are behind by seven ltters... foday.

conclude that no harm has been done. After all, it was jist one
day. But add up these days to make a year and then add up
these years to make a lifetime and perhaps you can now sce
how repeating today's small failures can easily turn your life
into a major disaster.
```
```
Success follows exactly the same pattern... in reverse. If
you plan to make ten calls and you go beyond your quota to
Tifteen, you're ahead by five phone calls... foday. Do the
same with your correspondence and your savings plan and soon
you'll see the accumulated fruits of your diligence over a year
and, eventually, over a lifetime.
```
```
Discipline is the master key. It unlocks the door to wealth
and happiness, culture and sophistication, high self-esteem and
high accomplishment, and the accompanying feclings of pride,
satisfaction, and success..
What does it take to acquire discipline?
First, it requires that you develop an awareness of the im-
portance of discipline in your lfe. Start by asking yourself:
“What do I want to accomplish in my life? What changes do
1 need to make in order to attain my goals?”"
Second, ask yourself konestly: “Am 1 willing to do what it
takes?"” If you answer “yes,” then you need to make a long-
term commitment to maintain your discipline wisely, deliber-
ately, consistently.
Finally, your commitment will be tested when circumstan-
ces emerge that could interfere with your commitment to your
new discipline — when you will kave to perform, come rain
or come shine.
Certainly discipline will do much for you. But of even
greater importance is what it will do fo you. It will make you
feel terrific about yourself.
Even the smallest discipline can have an incredible effect
on yourattitude. And the good feeling you get — that surging

fecling of self-worth which comes from starting a new
disci-
pline — is almost as good as the feling which comes from the
accomplishment of the discipline.
‘A new discipline immediately changes the direction of your
life, like a ship turning in mid-ocean and heading toward a
new destination
There are those who believe that discipline s unnatural

cipline cooperates with nature — where everything strives.

```
```
Action vs. Self-Delusion
```
```
In recent years there have been a number of books which
promote the idea that if one verbally affirms what onc wants
on a daily basis, success will magically emerge.
I'm completely opposed o this mode of thinking. In my
experience, affirmations without the discipline to act upon
those things which are affirmed cause men and women to de-
lude themselves into thinking they're making progress when,
in fact, their daily activity leads them nowhere ]
Why do people say one thing and then act in direct contra-
diction to their affirmations?
‘The man who dreams of wealth and yet walks daily toward
certain financial disaster and the woman who wishes for hap-
piness and yet thinks thoughts and commits acts that lead her
toward certain despair are both victims of the false hope which
affirmations tend to manufacture. Why? Because words soothe.
and, like a narcotic, they lull us into a state of complacency.
Remember this: TO MAKE PROGRESS YOU MUST AC-
TUALLY GET STARTED!
```
```
So, 10 have a prosperous life, start a prosperity plan. To
become wealthy, develop a “wealthy” plan. Remember, you
don't have to be wealthy to have a wealth plan; a person without
any means can have a “becoming rich” plan.
There are so many other types of plans which you can
create:
® If you are ill, start a health plan
® Do you feel tired all the time? Then start an energy plan.

```
```
* SUCCESS *
```
```
Successis the fifth key word. And like cach of the concepts
already discussed, it has multiple layers of meaning.
Success is also an elusive notion, a paradox. After all, it
is both a journey and a destination, isn’t it?
I’ the steady, measured progress toward a goal and the
achievement of goal. X
Success is hoth an accomplishment and a wisdom that
comes to those who understand the potential power of lfe.
It's an awareness of value and the cultivation of worthwhile
values through discipline.
Its both material and spiritual, practical and mystical.
Success is a process of turning away from something in
order 10 turn toward something better — from lethargy 10 ex-
ercise, from candy to fruit, from spending to investing.
Success is responding 1o an invitation to change, t0 grow,
10 develop, and to become — an imvitation to move up to a
better place in order to gain a better vantage point.
But most of all, success is making your life what you want
it 1o be. Considering all the possibilities, considering all the
examples of others whose lives you admire, what do you want
from your life? That is the big question!
Remember, suceess is not a set of standards from our cul-
ture but rather a collection of personal values clearly defined
and ultimately achieved.

```
One morning, two weeks after I started working for him,
Mr. Shoaff and I were having breakfast together. Just as I was,
about to inish my eggs, he said, “Jim, let’s take a look at your
list of goals so that we can review and discuss them. Maybe
that’s the best way | can help you right now.”
```
“No, sir, I don't have a list anywhiere.”
Mr. Shoaff sighed. “Well, young man, looks like this is
where we'd better start."”
‘Then, looking directly into my eyes, he said, “If you don't
have a list of your goals, 1 can guess your bank balance within
a few hundred dollars.” He guessed right. And that really got
my attention.
I'was astonished. “‘You mean that if I had a list of my goals
my bank balance would change?” | asked.
“Drastically,” he said.
‘That day | became a student of the art and science of goal-
setting.

setting has had the most profound effect on my life. Every

my bank balance, my lifestyle, my donations, even my per-

T am so convinced that mastering goal-setting can have a
profound effect on your life that I'm going to devote a great
deal of space to discussing this often misunderstood process.
In fact, I urge you to do more than just read the following
chapters. Study them. And if you have a notebook handy, so
much the better.

* THE POWER OF DREAMS *
```
```
Each and every one of our lves s affected by several fac-
tors. One of those factors is our environment — where we live,
what kind of parents we have, which schools we atiend, who
our friends are; each plays a role.
We are also shaped by the events in our lives. A war, for
example, can wrench all certainty from our psyche.
Knowledge, or the lack of it, will also shape our lives. So
can the results of our efforts — we can cither be elated or
deflated based on our ability to achieve those desired results.
Butof allthe factors that affect our lives, none has as much
potential power for doing good as our ability to dream.
Dreams are a projection of the life we wish to lead. There-
fore, when we allow them to “pull"” us, our dreams unleash a
creative force that can overpower all obstacles hindering the
attainment of our objectives.
To unharness this power, however, dreams must be well-
defined. A fuzzy future has little pull power. To really achieve
your dreams, 1o really have your future plans pull you, your
dreams must be vivid
Now, there are two ways to face the future: You can face
the future with anticipation or you can face it with apprehen-

sion. Guess how many people face the future with apprehen-
sion? Right, most do,
You've seen the type — always worrying, worrying, wor-
rying. Why are these individuals so apprehensive? Because
they haven't spent time designing their futures. In many cases,
they live their lives by trying to win the approval of someon¢.
else. In the process, they end up “buying into”” someone else’s
view of how life should be lived. No wonder they are worried
Ialways Tooking around, seeking approval for everything they
jo.
On the other hand, those who face the future with antici-
pation have planned a future worth getting excited about. They
can “'see” the future in their mind’s eye, and it looks terrifc.
“The future captures their imagination, and it exerts an enor-
‘mous pull on them.
```
```
+ THE POWER OF WELL-DEFINED GOALS *
```
```
Dreams are wonderful, but they are not enough. It not
sufficient to have a brilliant painting of the desired result. To
erecta magnificent structure one must also have a step-by-siep
blueprint of how to lay the foundation, support the structure,
and so on. And for that we need goals.
Like a well-defined dream, well-defined goals work like
magnets. They pull you in their direction. The better YOU

* REASONS *
```
```
Mr. Shoaff said to me, “Jim,^1 don't think your current
bank balance is a true indicator of your level of intelligence.”
(Boy, was 1 happy to hear that!) He continued, *1 think you
have plenty of talent and ability and that you're much smarter
than you realize." And that turned out to be true; I was smarter
than 1 thought at the time.
“Then i’}.y isn't my bank balance bigger?” 1asked.
“Because you don't have enough reasons to accomplish,
answered my friend. And then he added, “If you had enough
motivation you could do incredible things; you have enough
intelligence but not enough reasons.”
```
```
A key thought, indeed: HAVE ENOUGH REASONS.
```
```
Since then I've discovered this: Reasons come first, an-
swers second. It seems that life has a mysterious quirk of cam-
ouflaging the answers in such a way that they become apparent
only to those who are inspired enough to look for them — who
have reasons 10 look for them.
Let's put it another way. When you know what you want
and you want it badly cnough, you'll find a way 1o getit. The
answers, methods, and solutions you need to solve the prob-
lems along the way will be revealed to you. )

* FOUR GREAT MOTIVATORS *
```
```
The big question you'll need to answer for yourself is:
*“What motivates me?
Different things motivate different people. We all have our
own “hot butions." And if you doa bit of soul-scarching, I'm
sure you'll come up with a compelling list of your own.
Whatare some of the great motivators for excelling? Aside
from the obvious desire for financial gain there are four other
big motivators.
The first one is RECOGNITION. Great companies and
savvy sales managers know that some people will do more for
recognition than they will for material rewards.
‘That's why sucessful sales organizations, especially those
involved in direct sales, take great pains to give reconition
for any accomplishment, large or small. They know that in our
overcrowded world most people feel that nobody cares, that
they don't matter. And recognition is a kind of validation for
their worthiness. In effect, those who recognize others are
saying, “Hey. you are special, you make a difference.”
Lbelieve that if more companies took greater care 10 rec-
ognize their employees — not just the salespeople but also the.

exccutives, the secretaries, and the maintenance people — they
would see an unbelievable surge in productivity.

‘The second reason some people excel is because they like
the FEELING of winning. This is one of the best reasons
If you must be addicted to something, make it an addiction
to winning.
I have some friends, all millionaies, who sill work ten to
twelve hours a day making more millions. And it's not because
they need the money. It's because they need the joy, the pleas-
ure, and the satisfaction that come from their *wins.” To them,
money isn’t the big drive; they already have plenty. You know
‘whatitis? I’ the journey — the exhilarating feeling that comes

Oncein awhile, usually just after ] give a seminar, someone
will come up to me and say, “Mr. Rohn, if I had a million
dollars I'd never work another day in my life.” That's probably
why the good Lord sees to it that people who say things like
that never make a fortune. They would all just quit.

```
“The third great motivator is FAMILY. Some people will do
for their loved ones what they will not do for themselves.
Tonce met a man who told me, “Mr. Rohn, my family and
T have a goal to travel around the world. To do everything we
‘want o do will take a quarter of amillion dollars a year.” How
incredible! Could a man's family affect him that much? And
the answer is, “Of course!” How fortunate are those who are
50 profoundly affected by love!
```
```
BENEVOLENCE, the desire to share one’s wealth, is the
fourth greal motivator. When the great steel magnate Andrew
Carnegie died, his desk drawer was opened. Inside one of the
drawers was a yellowed sheet of paper. On that slip of paper,
dated from the time he was in his twenties, Carnegie had writ-
ten the main goal for his life: “T am going to spend the first

You know what? Carnegie was so inspired by this that he
accumulated 450 million dollars (which s equivalent to 4.
billion dollars today!). And, indeed, during the last part of his
life he had the joy of giving it all away.

Wouldn't it be wonderful to be motivated to achievement
by such a lofty goal as benevolence? I must confess, however,
thatin the early years of my struggle to succeed my motivation
was a Tot more down-lo-carth. My reason for succeeding was
more basic. In fact, it fell into the category of what I like to
call “nitty-gritty reasons.” A nitty-gritty reason s the kind
that any one of us can have — at any time, on any day — and
it can cause our lives to change. Let me tell you what happened

Shortly before I met Mr. Shoaff I was lounging at home
one day when I heard a knock at the door. It was a timid,
hesitant knock. When I opened the door I looked down to see
4 pair of big brown eyes staring up at me. There stood a frail
little girl of about ten. She told me, with all the courage and
determination her little heart could muster, that she was selling.
Girl Scout cookies. It was a masterful presentation — several
flavors, a special deal, and only two dollars per box. How
could anyone refuse? Finally, with a big smile and ever-so-
politely, she asked me to buy.
And 1 wanted to. Oh, how I wanted to!
Except for one thing. | didn’t have two dollars! Boy, was 1

name.
Naturally I couldn't tell this to the litrle girl with the big
brown eyes. So | did the next best thing. 1 lied to her. I said,
““Thanks, but I've already bought Girl Scout cookies this year.
And I've still got plenty stacked in the house."
Now that simply wasn't true. But it was the only thing |
could think of to get me off the hook. And it did. The litle girl
said, “That’s okay, sir. Thank you very much.” And with that
she turned around and went on her way.
1 stared after her for what seemed like a very long time.
Finally, I closed the door behind me and, leaning my back (o
it, cried out, “I don’t want to live like this anymore. I've had
it with being broke, and I've had it with Iying. Ill never be
embarrassed again by not having any money in my pocket.”
That day | promised myself to earn enough to always have
several hundred dollars in my pocket at all times.
“This is what | mean by a nitty-gritty reason. It may not win
me any prize for greatness, bu it was enough to have a per-
‘manent effect on the rest of my life
My Girl-Scout-cookie story does have a happy ending. Sev-

Gouls: How o Set Them

“Long-Range Goals.” Your task is to answer the question,
“What do | want within the next one to ten years?”"
The key to doing this exercise effectively is (o take as little
time as possible writing down as many items as possible. Take
between twelve to fifteen minutes for the whole exercise, and
try to write down about fifty different items.
To help you get started, consider the following half-dozen
questions as guidelines:

1. What do I want to do?
2. What do I want to be?
3. What do T want to sce?
4. What do | want to have?
5. Where do 1 want to go?
6. What would 1 like to share?

```
th these half-dozen queries in mind, answer the primary
question: “What do I want within the next one to ten years?”
Allow your mind to free-flow. Don’t try to be detailed now;
this will come later. For instance, if you want a gray Mercedes
380SL with a blue interior, just write *380" and move on to
the next item.
After you have completed your list, review what you've
writen.
Next put the number of years you believe it will take for
you to achiexve or to acquire cach item on your list. Next to the
items you think you'll reach in a year or so, write the number
“1.7 Next to the goals you believe will take approximately
three years to accomplish, write the number 3. Next to those
you think will take five years, write *5.” And finally, next to
```
```
Gouls. How 10 Set Them
```
```
those items you estimate will take ten y ars^10 attain, write
0.
Now, check to sce if your goals are in balance. For cx-
ample. if you find that you have lots of ten-year goals but very
few one-year goals, this could mean you're putting off having
{0 act now by postponing the target date.
On the other hand, if you have very few long-term goals,
perhaps you haven't yet decided what kind of life you want to
build over the long run
The key here is to develop a balance between shorter-term
and longer-term goals. (A little later we'll discuss true short-
term goals. These arc goals that take less than a year to
accomplish.)
```
```
Are you a bit bewildered by the idea of having too many
goals? Are you the kind of person who is more comfortable
focusing on one goal at a time?
Actually, there is a good reason for developing multiple
layers of goals. Without many and varied types of goals, you
could fall prey to the same thing that happened to some of our
early Apollo astronauts. Some of them, upon returning from
the moon, experienced deep emotional problems. The reason?
Once you've been to the moon, where clse do you go?
‘Alfter years of training, visualizing, and anticipating the
lunar light, that moment, glorious as it was, was gone. All of
asudden there scemed 1o be an end, a finish o their life’s work,
and depression st in.
As aresultof this experience, later astronauts were trained

Success. The only way to enjoy another meal is to get good
and hungry.
```

```
Goals: How 10 Set Them
```
```
* Kk Kk
```
Allight, now that you've reviewed and balanced your lst,
choose the four goals from each of the four time categorics
(one-year, three-year, five-year, ten-year) that you consider the
most important to you. You now have sixteen goals. For each,
write a short paragraph which includes the following:

1. A detailed description of what you want. For example,
    if it's a material object, describe how high, how long,
    how much, what model, what color, and so on. On the
other hand, if i’s a position or a business you want to
start, give a detailed job description including salary,
title, budget under your control, number of employees,
and so on.
2. The reason why you want to achieve or acquire the ilem
described. Here you'll find out if you really want it or
if it's just a passing fancy. If you can't come up with a
clearand convincing reason why you want t, you should
categorize this item as a whim, not as a true goal, and
replace it with something else.

```
You see, what you want is a powerful motivator only if
there s a good reason behind it. You may find that some goals
you once considered important no longer have appeal simply
because you are unable to find a good enough reason for want-
ing them. That's good. Doing this assignment is causing you
toreflect, refine, and revise. And that’s the whole point behind
this: 10 help you plan your future.
Once you have settled on your sixteen goals, copy them
onto a separate sheet of paper or into a permanent journal and
carry them with you at alltimes. Review them once a week to
see if they'e still important and if you are taking active steps

toward their realization. As you can see, goal-setting is not a
one-time task with the results set in concrete. Instead, it's a
continuous, lifelong process.
```
```
* SHORT-TERM GOALS *
```
```
1 define short-term goals as those which take anywhere
from a day 1o a year to achieve. And these goals, although by
necessity they are more modest than long-term goals, are of
equal importance. A ship captain may set his long-range course
toward his final destination, yet along the way there are many
short-range points of arrival which must be reached for the
voyage to be successful.
Now, just as in the case of a sea voyage, the short-term
‘goals must be related to your long-term achievements. Butthey
have the distinct advantage of being reachable in the foresee-
able future. | call these kinds of goals “confidence builders™
because their accomplishment gives you confidence to go on
So when you work hard, burn the midnight oil, and complete
a specific, short-term task, you can enjoy your “win' and be
re-inspired to continue your journey.
That's why 1 urge you 10 write down in your notebook or
journal your short-range projects as well. How you organize
this i up 10 you. You may, for example, arrange them by day,
by week, or by month. Or you may position them as sub-
categories of your long-term goals.
Part of the fun of having a list s the ability to check things
off. And when you check something off as completed, take
time 1o celebraté your achievement. This celcbration could be
a moment of satisfied reflection when you finish a small task
or a major reward when the accomplishment calls for it. Re-
gardless, do take time to enjoy your victories. It will only
inspire you 1o do more.
```

```
Gouls: How 10 Se Them
```
But just as 1 urge you to partake of the heady wine of
success, 1 have another, less popular recommendation: MAKE
LOSING PAINFUL.
You see, we grow from two kinds of experiences: the joy
of winning and the pain of losing. So if you set yourself on
course to complete a project and you fooled around instead,
find a way to pay for your laziness. Take responsibility for both
positive and negative behavior.
In addition, surround yourself with people who won't put
up with your usual baloney. Don'tjoin an casy crowd. Go where
the expectations are high, where the pressure to perform is
high. That, too, is part of your overall strategy for wealth and
happiness.

###### Making Them Work for You

The Bible says, “Without dreams and vision, we perish.”
How true! But you know. the opposite s also true. With dreams
we can be transformed in unique and unprecedented ways. In
the previous chapters I showed you how to choose your goals
and to start reaching for them. Now you'll learn how to let
your dreams mold your very existence.
First, you need to understand that once you set goals that
really matter to you, you are o longer the same person. Real
‘goals will affect almost everything you do all day long. And
they wil be with you wherever you go. Your handshake, your
manner of dressing, the tone of your voice, the way you
feel
—all will change once you have goals. That's because when
your goals matter, everything you do becomes related to their
accomplishment.
But for goals to really move you, to take charge of your
life, they must be worthy. I once asked a man, *What are your
goals for the month?” He said, “If I could just scrape up
enough
money to pay these lousy bills.. .” That was his goal!
Now I'm not saying that paying the bills can't be a goal —
it can. But it's such a poor goal. I certainly wouldn't put

* THE TRUE PURPOSE OF GOALS »
```
Let me share with you an intriguing thought. The real value
in setting goals is nor n their achievement. The acquisition of
the things you want is strictly secondary. The major reason for
setting goals i 10 compel you to become the person it takes to
achieve them. Let me explain:
What do you think is the greatest value in becoming a
millionaire? I it the million dollars? I don't think 0. No, the
reatest value is in the skills, knowledge, discipline. and lead-
ership qualities you'll develop in reaching that clevated status.
165 the experience you'll acquire in planning and developing
strategics. 1¢'s the inner strength you'll develop to have crough
courage, commitment, and willpower to attract a million
dollars.
Give a million dollars to someone who does not possess
the attifude of a millionaire and that person will most likely
lose it. But take away all the wealth from a irue millionaire
and in no time he or she will build a new fortune. Why? Be-
cause those who earn their millionaire status develop the skills,
knowledge, and experience to duplicate the process again and
again.

```
Goals: Making Them Work for You
```
```
As you can see, when someone becomes a millionaire, the
least important thing is what they have. The most important
hing is what they have become.
Here's a question you should spend some time pondering:
What kind of person will you have to become to get all you
want? In fact, why not write down a few thoughts on this in
your notehook or journal. Write down the kinds of skills you'll
heed to develop and the knowledge you'll need to gain. The
answers will give you some new goals for personal
development.
Remember this rule: INCOME RARELY EXCEEDS PER-
SONAL DEVELOPMENT, That's why all of us must subject
ourselves o self-examination.
Toften look at my life and ask, “Well, here’s what I want,
butam | willing 1o become the kind of person it will take?” If
I'm t00 lazy, if I'm not willing to learn, read, study, and grow
to become what I must become, then I cannot expect to attract
what I want. Now, when faced with a choice, I must decide to
cither change myself or change my wants.
```

* DON'T BECOME OVERWHELMED *

When setting goals, especially for the first time, it's casy
10 become overwhelmed by the process. My advice to you is,

that you've got this one down.
What does “ask” mean? Ask means “ask for what you
want." And the complete formula is staggering. It is: “Ask,
and you shall receive.” I think we'd better look into that ..
```
```
First, asking starts the process of receiving. Asking is like
pushing a button that unleashes incredible machinery, both in-
tellcctual and emotional.
‘As 1 said before, 1 don't know how or why it works, but I
do know it works.
There are a lot of things that work equally well whether we
understand the mechanism behind them or not. Just work them!
Some people never get started because they're always studying
the roots. And then there are others who choose to pick the
ruit while they study the roots. It all depends on which end
you want to start with. I recommend that you start asking.
Second, receiving, the other part of the formula, is not
problem. You don’t have to work on receiving. It's automatic.
So if receiving isn’t difficult, what's the problem? Its failing
toask
The “guy™ says, “Yes, but you work where I work, by the
time you struggle home it's late. You've got o get a bite toeat,
watch a little TV to relax, and then get to bed. You can't sit
up half the night and ask, sk, ASK.” Andhis fellow is behind
on his bills. He's a good worker, a hard worker, a sincere
worker. But you've got 1o do better than work hard and be
sincere all your life, or you'll wind up broke and embarrassed.
You've got to be better than a good worker. You've got 10 be
a good asker.
“Isee it now," he says.^1 got up every day this past year
and hit it hard. But nowhere in my house is there a list of the
things I ask of life.”
```
```
How about you... how s your list?
```

Goals: Making Them Work for You

‘Third, receiving is like the ocean — there’s plenty. This is
especially true in this country. It like an ocean here! Success
is not in short supply. It isn't rationed so that when your turn
comes they already gave it all away. No, no!
1 that's true, what's the problem? The problem is that most
people go to this ocean of opportunity with teaspoon. Have
You got the picture? A teaspoon! In View of the size of the
ocean, may [ suggest that you trade in your teaspoon for some-
thing bigger? How about a pail? It may not be the best you can
do, but at least kids won't make fun of you.

```
Two more thoughts about asking
```
```
First, ask with intelligence. The Bible may not say, “Ask
intelligently.” But I have no doub that this s what is meant.
So don’t mumble. You won't get anything by mumbling. Be
clear... be specific. Asking intelligently includes answering
how high, how long, how much, when, what size, what model,
what color. Describe what you want. Define it. Remember,
well-defined goals are like magnets. The better you chisel
them, the stronger they pull
Second, ask with faith. Faith s the childlike part. It means
believe that you can get what you want. Believe as a child
believes. Believe without the skepticism and cynicism of the
adultin you
You see, many of us have become roo skeptical. We've lost
that wonderfully innocent, childlike faith and trust. Don’t let
this stop you. Believe in and have faith in yourself and your
goals. And getexcited —just likea child. Childlike enthusiasm
— there’s nothing more contagious.
Children think they can do anything. They want to know
about everything. How wonderful! They hate t0 go to bed at
nightand cant wait to jump out of bed in the morning. Children
can ask a thousand questions. And just when you think you're
teady to climb the wall, they”ll ask a thousand more. They will

drive you to the brink. But, of course, their curiosity is really
avirtue. When you rekindle your own childlike sense of cu-
rious enthusiasm, you will be well on your way to becoming a
‘masterful asker.
```
```
* GOAL-SETTING
AND TIME MANAGEMENT *
```
```
‘Time management is a popular topic these days. Al kinds
of books, tapes, and seminars are offered to a public that is
hungry for information on how 10 use time more productively.
How about you? Would you like to become a better time
manager? Then you need to understand this: UNLESS YOU
HAVE GOALS, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MANAGE YOUR
TIME EFFECTIVELY. Productivity is a result of well-defined
objectives. The allocation of time is not critical if objectives
ave not firm and vividly planted in the mind. I’ that simple.
“This is one of the many reasons why writing goals down on
paper is so important.
```
```
* PRIORITIES *
```
```
One of the difficulties we face in our industrialized age is
the fact that we've lost our sense of seasons. Unlike the farmer
whose priorities change with the seasons, we have become
impervious to the natural rhythm of life. As a result, we have
our priorities out of balance. Let me illustrate what | mean:
For a farmer, springtime is his most active time. I¢'s then
that he must work around the clock, up before the sun and still
toiling at the stroke of midnight. He must keep his equipment
running at full capacity because he has but a small window of
```
```

```

```
Making The Work for You
```
time for the planting of his crops. Then comes winter when
there is less for him to o to keep him busy.
There is a lesson here. Learn to use the seasons of life.
Decide when to pour it on and when (o ease back, when to take:
advantage and when to let things ride. It's casy to keep going
from nine to five year in and year out and lose a natural sense
of priorities and cycles. Don't let one year blend into another
in a scemingly endless parade of tasks and responsibilitics.
Keep your eye on your own seasons, lest you lose sight of value
and substance.

```
Majors and Minors
```
```
An important part of setting priorities s learning to sep-
arate the minors of your life from the majors. Here is a good
question to ask yourself whenever you have to make a decision.
1s this a major or a minor? By asking this, always with your
goals in mind, you'll reduce the risk of spending major time
on minor projects.
In sales we are taught that there exists only one major time.
That's the time we spend in the presence of a prospect. Any
time spent on the way to the prospect, no matter how essential,
is minor time. Too many salespeople spend more time **on the
way to” than “with.” And their incomes reflect this. That's
why in sales we teach, “Don’t go across town until you've gonc
across the street.”
The majors and minors concept has another application. It
also says, don’t spend minor time on major things. It casy to
‘get values all mixed up. A parent spends three hours watching
TV and only ten minutes playing with the children. A manager
spends most of the day filling out forms and very little time
encouraging his employees. These are people who have lost a
sense of what's important and what's trivial.

‘This same concept also applies to money. Don't spend ma-
jor money on minor things, and, conversely, don't spend minor
‘money on major things. Some peaple spend a fortune on food
for their bodies and very lttle on food for their minds. If you
spend more on candy than on inspirational books and tapes,
that would be foolish, right?
```
```
‘The best use of time and money comes from putting max-
imum value in it. It's called careful investment for maximum
results.
```
```
* CONCENTRATION »
```
```
Any professional athlete can tell you about the horrible
costs of lack of concentration. Just a momentary slip of con-
centration and “they put one by your feet.” And there goes
first place and the big money. Don't let it happen to you.
Put maximum attention to everything you do. When you
write a letter, concentrate. Trying to solve a problem? Con-
centrate. Having a conversation? That's right, concentrate. You
won't believe the effect this will have on your life.
Naturally, there is a time to let your mind wander. But do
it during a period that you've set aside especially for doing just
that. And when you wander, do nothing elsc. Go off for that
walk on the beach or that drive in the mountains — away from
the pressures of life. Let the breeze blow through your hair and
let your mind soar. Daydream. That's good for you. But do it
only at the time you designate as " daydreaming time.” At all
other times, concentrate.

# STRATEGY TWO

## Seek Knowledge


```
Chapter 5
```
The Path to Wisdom

One of the fundamental strategies of living the good life is
knowing what information you need in order to achieve your
aims. And once you know what you need to know, it’s also
helpful to know how to go about gathering that knowledge.
‘One of the best things Mr. Shoaff did for me in those carly
days was to instill in me the value of study.
He said, “If you wish to be successful, study success. If
you wish to be happy, study happiness. If you want to make
‘money, study the acquisition of wealth. Those who achieve
these things don’t do it by accident. It's a matter of studying
first and practicing second.”
Would you like to guess how many people make wealth a
study? Right, very few. Considering the many men and women
who seek wealth and happiness, you'd think they would make
a careful study of them, don't you agree? Why they don't is
et another in that special category 1 call “mysteries of life.”

```
Many years ago I learned that some of the best advice ever
given comes from the Bible. There's a phrase in this amazing
book that says, “If you search, you shall find." So that s the
way to discover new knowledge that creates new ideas. Search.
In order to find something, you must first search. Need a great
idea to change your life? Rarely will it come out of nowhere.
Butif you make a diligent search for the knowledge you need,

the right idea will come your way, often when you least
expect it

```
* CAPTURING THE TREASURES
‘OF KNOWLEDGE *
```
```
Here is another fundamental word for you to ponder: cap-
tre. Great ideas pass by quickly and are easily forgotien
as can be truc of those moments that make life worth living,
That's why it so important to learn to capture those things
that really matter
First, learn to capture special moments. Use acamera. Take
lots of pictures. Being able to capture an event in a fraction of
asecond s a twentieth-century phenomenon. And how casy it
s to take phenomena for granted!
Let me tell you about a recent experience. Over the past
three years I've been invited to lecture annually in Taiwan. On
my most recent trip to give a weekend seminar, there were
about a thousand people in attendance. Now, if there were one
thousand people in atiendance, guess how many cameras were.
also in the room? Right — one thousand! Everyone brought a
camera to capture the moments, the new friends, the new ex-
periences. | ended up spending a big part of my time there
posing for pictures.
Have you ever looked at the pictures of a few generations
ago? Unfortunately there are relatively few still in circulation.
But wouldn't it be wonderful if, instead, we had enough pic-
tures to tell the whole story of what life was really like a
hundred years ago? So don’t be lackadaisical. Make sure you
leave behind your whole story through a treasury of photo-
graphs and videos.
‘Another way to capture knowledge i in your own personal
library. I don’t mean the books your interior designer bought
```
```
s
```
```
The Puth 10 Wisdom
```
```
because they match with the blue decor. I mean those books
that are dog-cared and well-marked — the ones you chose to
study and underline; books with notes written in the margins;
books that helped shape your philosophy of life values. That
is truly a treasure worth capturing!
‘Today, with our expanded concept of communication, I'd
alsoinclude in this treasure all the cassette tapes and videotapes
that are shaping our lives for the better. That, too, is a special
legacy to our children.
```
```
Finally, you'll want to capture all the knowledge you gain
a5 you live your life. That's why | encourage you, as a serious
student of wealth and happiness, to make use of a journal or
diary as a gathering place for all the ideas that come your way.
‘What will gradually emerge is an incredible treasure — busi-
ness ideas, social ideas, cultural ideas, investment ideas, life-
style ideas. Can you imagine the value in this? Certainly this
kind of treasure is a more valuable heirloom than your old
clock!
```
```
* HOW TO GAIN WISDOM *
```
```
There are two ways to gather wisdom. One way is (o learn
from your own life. The second is to study the lives of others.
```
```
Personal Reflection
```
```
Go over your life experiences. Learn the skill of eflection,
which is the act of pondering life’s events with the intent of
learning from them. I cal this process *rerunning the tapes.”
The events of your life are some of the best sources of
information. So don’t merely go through your days — get from
your days. Be aware of whats going on around you so that
```
```

```

The Puth o Wisdom

```
you'll drive the grooves in the record of the day deep into your
Consciousnes
There is a time and a place for everything. There are times
to act and times to reflect. Most of s don't take the time for
Serious reflection. With our busy schedules we often neglect
this crucial part of the formula for success.
At the end of the day take a few moments o review the
happenings of the day — where you went, what you did, what
you said. Ponder what worked and what didn't, what you want
10 repeat and what you want to avoid. Try to remember inci-
dents as vividly as possible. Remember the colors, the sights,
the sounds, the conversations, the experiences.
You sce, experience can become commodity, currency,
coin — an incredible source of value. But it can become all
those things only if you take the time to record the experience,
to ponder it, and then furn it into something of value. After
all, it's not what happens toa person that makes the difference
i how his or her life turns out. Rather, it's what he or she does
with what happens that determines the outcome. And to do
something positive about life, we must glean valuable infor-
mation from it.
```
```
Another good time to reflect s at the end of major periods
such as a week, a month, or a year. At the end of the week take
a few hours for reflection to ponder the events of the past seven
days. At the end of a month take a day. And at the end of a
year take a week... to review, ponder, and reflect on every-
thing that has happened in your life.
Sophisticated people have learned how to gather up the past
and invest it in the future. When my father turned seventy-six
I said to him, “Dad, can you imagine what it's going to be like
to gather up the last seventy-five years and invest them in your
seventy-sixth!”
Have you ever thought of life this way? That's how it can
become productive and ever-exciting. Don't just live another
year. Instead, gather up the years and invest them in the next
```

```
one. Don't just have another conversation. Instead, gather up
all your past conversations and invest them in your next one:
```
```
Sostart up a new discipline. Find out, by observing your
life, what and how things work in this world. Never let it be
said that you lived life without finding out about it. You may
not be able to do all you find out, but make sure you find out
all you can do. You don’t want to live your life only to find
that, ultimately, you lived only one-tenth of it that you let the
other nine-tenths go down the drain
In studying your life, be sure to study the negatives as well
as the positives, your failures as well as your successes. Our
so-called failures serve us well when they teach us valuable
lessons. Often, they're better teachers than our successes.
Onc of the ways we learn to do something rightis by doing
it wrong. Doing things wrong is a valuable course i life. Now,
1 would suggest that you not take this course for fo0 long. If
you've been doing something the wrong way for the past ten
Years, I wouldn't recommend another ten. But f you can learn
quickly, there is no better, more emotionally effective way to
Tearn than from personal experience.
```
```
When I met Mr. Shoaff I'd been working for six years.
Shortly after we met he asked me, “Jim, how long have you
been working now?” I told him.
““How are you doing?” he inquired further.
“Not very well,” I said, a bit annoyed at having to admit
this.
*“Then I suggest you notdo that anymore, ” he replied. “Six
years is long cnough to operate the wrong plan.”
Then he asked, **How much money have you saved in the
past six years?”
“None,” I admitted sheepishl
Raising his eyebrows, he “aid. “Who sold you on that
plan?”

plan? Hey, everyone has bought someones plan. The question
s, whose?

```
WHOSE PLAN HAVE YOU BOUGHT?
```
Now, 1 must tell you that those initial confrontations with
your own past experiences will be painful. This is especially
true if you've made as many mistakes as I have. But think of
the pay-off! Think of the progress you can make when you
finally confront those errors!

Learning from Others

Another way you can gain knowledge is vicariously,
through other people’s experiences. And you can learn from
other people’s successes as well as from their failures. One of
the reasons the Bible is such a good teacher is because it’s a
collection of human stories on both sides of the ledger.
One list of stories is called *examples.” The message is:
Do what these people did. The other list of stories is called
“warnings.” The message is: Don’t do what these fools did.
What a wealth of information!
But perhaps there is even another message. If your story
ever gets into somebody’s book, make sure it's used as an
example, not as a warning...

```
There are three ways one can go about learning from others:
```
1. Through published literature such as books and audio
    tapes or videotapes
2. By listening to the wisdom and folly of others.
3. Through observations of winners and losers.

```
The Path 10 Wisdom
```
```
Let’s discuss cach of these areas one by one:
```
```
Books and Tapes
```
```
Al the successful people with whom I have had contact are
zo0d readers. They read, read, read. It's their curiosity that
drives them o read. They simply have to know. They constantly
seck new ways to become better. Here is a good phrase to
remember: ALL LEADERS ARE READERS.
‘There used (o be a time when publishing always referred
o printed matter, such as books. But today we can learn
through the miracle of electronic publishing as well. I'm re-
ferring to audio tapes and videotapes, both of which are ex-
cellent ways to acquire knowledge.
Many of the busiest people I know use audio casseties to
learn during unproductive times. For example, they often listen
totapes while driving in their cars. Listening to cassettes is an
easy way 10 pick up innovative ideas and new skills.
Did you know there are thousands of books and tapes on
how to be stronger, more decisive, a better speaker, a more
effective leader, a better lover; develop influence: find a mate;
become more sophisticated:; start a business — and thousands
of other useful topics? And yet many people do not use this
wealth of knowledge. How do you explain that?
Did you further know that thousands of successful people
have committed their inspiring stories to paper? And yet people:
don’t want to read. How would you explain rhar?
Our “guy” is busy, I guess. He says, “Well, yeah. But you
work where 1 work, by the time you siruggle home it's late.
Youve got (0 have a bite to eat, watch a little TV t0 relax, and
20 10 bed. You can’t stay up half the night and read, read,
READ.” And this is the guy who is behind on his bills. He's
agood worker, a hard worker. a sincere worker. Hey, you can
be sincere and work hard all your lfe and still wind up broke,
confused, and embarrassed. You've got o be better than a good

worker. You've got to be a good reader. And if you don't like
0 read, at least you can listen 1o a good cassette on the way
home, right?
Now you don't have to read books or listen to tapes half
the night (although if you're broke, it's not such a bad idea).
Al ask is that you devote just thirty minutes a day to learning.
That's all.
‘You wantto really do well? The stretch your thirty minutes
0 a full hour. But at least spend thirty minutes. Oh yes, here’s
one more thing: Don't miss. Miss a meal, but not your thirty
minutes of learning. All of us can afford to miss a few meals,
but none of us can afford to lose out on ideas, examples, and
inspiration.

```
‘The Bible teaches us that humans cannot live on bread
alone. It tells us that next to food, our minds and souls must
be nourished by words. Unfortunately, most peaple suffer from
mental malnutrition.
Recently | told my staff, “Some people read so little that
they have rickets of the mind.” Not only should you feed your
mind, you should make sure you have a well-balanced mental
diet. Don’t just feed your mind the casy stuff. You can't live
on mental candy.
Think of your reading time as “tapping the treasure of
ideas” time. And if somebody’s got a good excuse for not
tapping the treasure of ideas for at least thirty minutes every
day or not investing some money on the acquisition of knowi-
edge, then I'd like o hear it. Some excuses you would not
believe!
```
```
I'say, “John, I've got this gold mine. I've got so much gold
I don’t know what to do with it all. Come on over and dig.”
John says, “But I don’t have a shovel.”

Hey, invest the money. Get the books and tapes you need
for your self-education. Don't shortchange yourself when it
comes to investing in your own better future.
Mr. Shoaff got me started on books from the beginning.
He said, “Become self-educated. Standard education will
bring you standard results. Check the income figures of those
th a standard education and see if that's what you want. If
it isn't, if you want more than the average, you must become
self-educated.” So 1 went to work on building a library. And
today I have one of the best
Mr. Shoaff recommended a couple of books to get me
started. One was the Bible, which I already had. It consists of
sixty-six books and my parents saw to it that I was well-ac-
quainted with them, so I figured | had a pretty good start.
But he also insisted that | get Think and Grow Rich by
Napoleon Hill. If you haven't yet read it, | suggest you run
right out and get a copy:
1 must have read this great book several dozen times. 1
neededto. Mr. Shoaff said, *Repetition is the mother of skill.”
And the way my bank account was, 1 needed lors of skill.
As ook back, the information in the book has been worth
tens of thousands of dollars to me. And yet I bought it for
pennies. This taught me a powerful lesson: THERE CAN BE
AGREAT DEAL OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COST AND
VALUE. Before | met Mr. Shoaff, | used to ask, “How much
does it cost?” But he taught me to ask, “What is it worth?”
When I started to base my life on value instead of price, all
kinds of things began to happen.
```
```
Remember: YOU ARE WHAT YOU READ.
```

The Path 10 Wisdom

```
One of the first things | do when I visit someone is 10 look
through his or her library. I find out more by looking through
someone’s book and tape collection than 1 do through idle
conversation.
Mostly, a library, or lack of one, tells me what a person is
thinking or if he or she is thinking at all. The choice of books
and tapes reveals a person's predominant thoughs, desires,
and values.
‘What does your library say about you? You see, reading
books is not some leisure-time luxury;it's anecessity for those.
who want 1o grow. So don't be like some of my friends who
thought that graduating from high school or college gave them
license 10 never read a book again. Start reading. And espe-
cially read the kinds of books that will help you to unleash your
inner potential.
‘Are you now thinking about all the books you should read?
Then here's some good news: You don't have to read all these
booksat once. Try reading two booksa week. And if that scems
like & lot, choose two thin books to start with. Do this for ten
years and you'll end up reading over one thousand books! Do,

will influence the many dimensions of your life? Of course it

Now i’ also true that if you haven't been reading twobooks

dible disadvantage you'll have in ten years if you stride into
the marketplace two thousand books behind? Wh, for some.
of the more sophisticated confrontations you will serve as can-
non fodder. They will chew you up and spit you out
But that's not all. You'll also miss out on some terrific
opportunities because of lack of knowledge. And your philos-
ophy will be too shallow to sustain you through ife’s hardships.
Missing skills, missing knowledge, missing insight, miss-
ing values, missing lifestyle are all a result of not reading

books. Remember, the book unread is the one that can't help
you. You can’t read too many books but you can read too few.
```
```
Listening
```
```
Listening is a wonderful way to learn. Let me propose to
youan outrageous idea: Choose a really successful person and
take him o her out to dinner. A poor person (and we're all
poor compared to someore, no matter how well we're doing)
should investin feeding a rich person. And then do what? That's
right — listen.
Goahead, try it. Spend fifty, sixty, eighty, even a hundred
dollars. Go for the full nine courses. Start with the hors
d’oeuvres, and ask questions. Eat the salad (it will take about
fifieen minutes) and keep the conversation going. The biggest
steak in town will take forty-five minutes to demolish — keep
asking questions. Order dessert. See how long you can stretch
the meal. Try for at least two hours. If you get someone like
this o talk with you for two hours, you can learn enough
strategies and attitudes to multiply your income and change
your lfe.
```
```
But of course you're right. Poor people don't take rich
peaple out to dinner. That's probably why they're poor.
The “guy” says, “If he’s rich, let him buy his own darn
dinner! I'm not coming up with any money. And besides, if
you work where 1 work, by the time you siruggle home, it's
late. You've got to have a bite to eat, watch a litle TV to relax,
and get to bed. You can't spend all that time trying (o find a
rich man to feed.” And this man s behind on his payments.
Behind! He's a good worker, a hard worker, a sincere worker.
But you can work hard and be sincere all your life and still
wind up broke and unhappy. You've got 1o be better than a
200d worker. You've got to be a good listerer.

who do well own the habits of success. They create patterns
of
winning behavior just as the straggler creates patterns of losing
behavior. You want to be promoted? Observe your superiors.
Want to make as much money as your uncle? Obscrve how he
‘manages his money and his lifestyle.
One of the reasons it’s a good idea to attend seminars given
by successful people s because you canobserve them. Nobook
or cassette, no matter how good, can convey the silent power
of non-verbal communication. This is why videocassettes arc
hecoming wonderful tools for total communication.
So become a good obscrver. Don't miss any clue that can
help you change your lifc for the better.

The search for knowledge is one of the strategies for wealth
and happiness. What a powerful thought, to spend time in
a
consistent, disciplined, purposeful search for knowledge.
But as with everything clse that's worthwhile, there’s a
price to pay. And this, unfortunately, stops some dead in their
tracks. The search for knowledge involves making an invest-
ment. In fact, there are three kinds of investments it will take.
for you to successfully embark on this journey:
First, it will take the expenditure of moncy. It does take
Some money to purchase books and casseties and to attend
seminars. That's why I recommend you set up your own edu-
cational fund.

```
The Puth o Wisdom
```
```
Each month, set aside a portion of your income and invest
it in your search for knowledge. Spend the money to cultivate
the sleeping giant inside you. The money — that’s a small
price. The promise is unlimited potential
Moreimportant than money i your next expenditure: time.
‘Time is a major expenditure. T understand that. It one thing
1o ask a person to spend money, but it's an entirely different
thing o ask him for his time.
Alas, there are no shortcuts. Until such time that a machine
can be hooked up to pour knowledge into the brain, it will take
time — precious time.
Fortunately, life has a unique way of rewarding high in-
vestment with high return. The investment of time you make
now may be the catalyst for major accomplishment.
Finally, you'll be making an investment of effort. There is
a great deal more effort involved in serious learning than in
casual learning. In everything you do, be it self-observation,
reading, or observing others, the intensity of your efforts will
have a profound effect on the amount of knowledge you gain.
A focused mind is like a mental rifle shot that strikes an
idea target. And to be that focused takes much concentrated
effort. Butit s precisely this effort that will open the floodgates

bring you closer 1o wealth and happiness.

The Miracle of Personal

Development

One day Mr. Shoaff said, “Jim, if you want to be wealthy
and happy, learn this lesson well: Learn to work harder on
yourself than you do on your job.
Since that time I've been working on my own personal
development. And I must admit that this has been the most
challenging assignment of zll. This business of personal de-
velopment lasts a lifetime.
‘You see, what you become is far more important than what
you get. The important question to ask on the jobis not, “What
am [ getting?” Instead, you should ask, “What am [ becom-
ing?” Getting and becoming are like Siamese twins: What you
become dircctly influences what you get. Think of i this way:
Most of what you have today you have attracted by becoming
the person you are today.
So here’s the great axiom of life: TO HAVE MORE THAN
YOU'VE GOT, BECOME MORE THAN YOU ARE. This is
where you should focus most of your attention. Otherwise, you
just might have to contend with the axiom of ot changing,
which is: UNLESS YOU CHANGE HOW YOU ARE,
YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

responsibilities that come with it, it will usually shrink back

If someone hands you a million dollars, you'd beter hurry
up and become a millionaire. A very rich man once said, “If
you took all the money in the world and divided it equally
among everybody. it would soon be back in the same pockets
it was before.”
I'T'S HARD TO KEEP THAT WHICH HAS NOT BEEN
OBTAINED THROUGH PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT.

* VALUE »
```
```
In my carly days there were several things that used to
puzzle me. | used to wonder, **Why would one person be paid
two thousand dollars a month and another be paid four thou-
sand a month when they both work for the same company,
handle the same product, work the same number of years, and
come from the same background?”
‘What a puzzle! Why would one person do twice as well
cconomically? In the area of compensation, what's the differ-
ence between two thousand and four thousand a month? (And
don't tell me “two thousand dollars.” That kind of difference
L could've figured out even back then.)
“It must be a matter of time, " I thought. “‘Some people do
much better because they have more time. Mary ought 1o do
well. She's got alot of time. If | had all of Mary's time, [ could
also do well.” Now that's got to be dumb, right? You can't get
someone else’s time.
A man once said to me, “If 1 had some extra time, I would
make some extra money.” I said, “Then you'll have to forget
it. There isn't any more time. Where would you find any?"
Listen, my friend, when the clock strikes midnight, that's
it It all over. There isn't any more time. And if you insist on

```

```
```
finding more than twenty-four hours in one day, they'll come
and take you away.
```
```
So if you can't create more time, what could you create
that would make the difference in economic results? The an-
swers value. Value makes the difference. You can never create
‘more time, but you can become more valuable.
‘This concept of valuc is a primary lesson in economics.
Whether you work on the assembly line or sell goods or ser-
vices, you get paid for the value. Now I know that you'll spend
time bringing value to the marketplace. But you don't get paid
for the time, you get paid for the value, for your productivity
Mistakenly, the “guy” says, I make twenty dollars an
hour.” That's not true! I it were rue, he could just stay home
and have them send over the money. No, he doesn't get paid
twenty dollars for the four. He gets paid twenty dollars for the
value which has heen placed on the hour he works. Paying by
the hour is simply a convenient way to measure anticipated
value,
“That's why it’s important to ask, “Is it possible to become
twice as valuable and make twice as much money per hour? Is
there a way for me to become three times or even four times
more valuable within the same hour?” And the answer is, “Of
course!”” You can become more valuable if... (And there is
always an if, right? Life is known as the “Big If." Harry
“Truman once said, “Lifeis iffy.” *) i you gotowork primarily
on yourself.
You see, it's easy to get “faked out.” The “guy" says,
“T've got ten years’ experience. I don't know why I'm not
doing beter.” What he hasn't realized is that he doesn't have
ten years” experience. What he has is one year's experience
repeated ten times. He basn’t made a single improvement, a
single innovation in nine years!
Everybody wants more money. But most people look for it
in the wrong places. Our “guy” says, “I need more money.

I'm going o work on my boss.” Hey. I've found that bosses

Gll. 've never seen a boss get suddenly excited and for no

Some people say, *We'll strike for more.” The problem is
that once you start striking you'll almost always have to strike.

you'll get will be litle bitty pieces — barely cnoughto get by.

‘They say, “We'll get some of those sales books that teach the
tricky sales. We'll lay it on the prospects, dazzle them with the

shows that unless you give fair value, you'll wind up at the
bottom of the economic ladder.

But | found out that real performance comes from those who

outside. Then 1 leamed that success and happiness are not
values to pursue; they are values to develop.
People often ask me. “How do I develop an above-average
income?” The answer is, become an above-average person.
How?
For starters, develop an above-average handshake. Some
people who say they want to succeed don't even work on their
handshake. As casy as it would be to improve, they let it slide.
They don't understand. Do you want to be above-average?

Then develop an above-average smile; develop an above-av-

There is nothing more pointless than looking for an above-
average job with above-average pay without becoming an
above-average performer. I call his frustration.

Not long ago 1 did a seminar in Honolulu for a group of oil

Here are two phrases | want you to consider: The first is,
“Life and commerce are like the seasons.” The second i
“You cannot change the seasons but you can change yourself.”
Now, with these two phrases as guides, lets take a look at
the seasons of life and how you can best handle them:

Winter: A Time to Grow Strong

First and foremost, learn how to handle winters. There are
all Kinds of winters. There are economic winters, when the

financial wolves are at the door; there are physical winters,
when our health is shot; there are personal winters, when our
heart is smashed to pieces. Wintertime. Disappointments. Lo-
neliness. That's how the Blues were written.
So the big question is how do we handle the winters. Some
people g0 to the calendar, tear out the month of January, and
pretend it isn't there. But that’s the childish approach. It solves
nothing.
Let me tell you what mature people do: They get stronger.
‘They get wiser. They get better.
Not a bad idea — to use the winter for personal
development.
Before | understood this, I used to spend my winters look-
ing for summers. I didn’t understand.
‘Then, finally, when I was going through a sales slump, Mr.
Shoaf said, “Don’t wish it were easier, wish you were better.
Don’t wish for fewer problems, wish for more skills. Don't
wish for less of a challenge, wish for more wisdom.” Since
then I can’t honestly tell you that I've welcomed the winters,
but I can tell you that I've used them to gear up for spring,
which always comes after winter.

Spring: A Time to Take Advantage

Learn to take advantage of spring. What a great place for
spring o be, right after winter. Opportunity follows difficulty.
Expansion follows recession — just like clockwork. God is a
genius.

two words. TAKE ADVANTAGE. Don'tle the balmy weather
confuse you. If you want to look good in the fall, this is the
time to plant the sceds. In fact, we all have to excel at one of
two things. Either we become good at planting in the spring
or we learn how to beg in the fall.

S0 get busy in the spring. There is just a handful of springs
for each of us. The Beatles wrote, “Life is so short.” And for
John Lennon on the streets of New York, life was extra short.

Summer: A Time to Take Care

Learn to nourish and protect your crops all summer. You
can bet that as soon as you've planted, the insects and weeds
will try to destroy your crop. And they will succeed, unless
you prevent them.
Part of succeeding is learning to protect what you've cre-
ated. And that’s the greatest lesson of summer.
Here are two truths you'll learn during your summers:
First, you'll learn thatall good will be attacked. Don't press
me for the reason. | don’t know why. But I do know that it's
true. Every garden will be invaded. Not to understand this is
naive.
Second, you'll learn that all values must be defended. Al
values — social, political, marital, commercial — must be
defended. Every garden must be tended all summer. Unless.
you defend what you believe in, come fall you'll have nothing
left.

```
Fall: A Time to Take Responsibility
```
```
Fall is the season where we reap the results of our springs
and summers. Maturity can be defined by our ability to take
full responsibility for the crops we have tended, either bountiful
or meager.
Accepting full responsibility is one of the highest forms of
human maturity — and one of the hardest. It' the day you
pass from childhood to adulthood.
Learn to welcome fall without apology or complaint —

without apology if you've done well and without complaint if

T used to have a lot of problems in this area, back in those
carly days. Just in case anyone asked, 1 used to carry with me
a list of the reasons I wasn't doing well. My list, which |
predictably called *“reasons for not doing well” included lots
of alibis
1 blamed the government. The government was at the top
of my list.
1 blamed taxes. “Look what you've got left after they take
everything out.”
I blamed prices. *You walk into a supermarket with twenty
dollars and come out with half a bag of groceries.”
1 blamed the weather.
1 blamed the traffic.
1 blamed my car and the car manufacturer.
T blamed my negative relatives: “They are always putting
me down.”
1 blamed my cynical neighbors.
1 blamed the community.
Hey, I had lots of good reasons for not doing well. At least
1 thought I did.

Mr. Shoaff was very kind, but he was also blunt. One day
he looked up at me and with a quizzical expression on his face
asked, “Jim, just out of curiosity, tell me why you haven't done

Well, so that I wouldn't look bad, I decided to run through
my list. How I ever had the nerve I'll never know, but I did
1 went through the whole litany — the government, taxes,
prices — everything. He listened patiently as I went through it
all. When I was finished he peered at my list fora few moments.
Finally, shaking his head, he said, “There's only one thing
wrong with your list... You ain't on it.”

```
+ SELF-IMPOSED LIMITATIONS *
```
```
To be successful we must all work to eliminate those self-
imposed limitations that are stunting our personal develop-
ment. And no matter who you are, there are three self-imposed
limitations you have to contend with. Let me tell you about
them.
```
```
“The first limitation is procrastination. Procrastination is
especially dangerous because of ts accumulating nature: When
we put off doing some minor task, it doesn't seem to be all that
important. And if we let a few things slide during the day, it
doesn’t scem like such a bad day. But let enough of those days
pile up and you have the makings of a disastrous year.
```
```
Blame is another self-imposed limitation. At one time or
another all of us have blamed someone for something. We have
had long training in this self-imposed fimitation going back to
4 certain fruit garden where the man said, “It was the woman.
She got me into this.” And the woman blamed the serpent.
Why do we point fingers instead of looking within? The
cgo strives to defend itself. Therefore, when we blame outside
forces we don't have to face our own weaknesses and failings.
This must have been my reason for keeping my infamous “list
of reasons.”
One of my favorite items on the list was the high cost of
everything. One day, after some inane statement I made about
the cost of an item, Mr. Shoaff cut me short. “Listen, Jim,"
he said, “cost is not your problem. It's not that if costs t00
much. The problem is that you can't afford. And he was
right.
16s never the fault of ir. If you keep shifting responsibility
o ir you'll always be broke and disillusioned. You'll neverearn
cnough. But when you start thinking in terms of “me” instead
of “it” you'll experience a surge of personal growth and
income.
```

```
The Miract of Personal Devl
```
```
Excuses, the third self-imposed limitation, is a close rela-
tive of blame. Guess how many excuses exist? Right, millions!
And people create a million more in the course of their lives.
In fact, people go to tremendous lengths to avoid facing the
truth — which is that they are responsible. I guess they*d rather
create a million excuses than create a million dollars. (You
can't have both.)
```
```
Sohere is the fundamental question you must answer: What
are you going to do, starting foday, to improve yourself? It
really boils down to this: If you don't get rid of some of your
own self-imposed limitations, the next five years will be about
the same as the last, except that you'll be five years older. But
by taking responsibility and getting rid of your self-impased
limitations, you can, instead, become five years better. Now,
doesn’t this sound more exciting?
```
There are many who have litle faith in their own ability.
‘They ask themselves, “What am I capable of doing? What can
1do to make a difference in how my life turns out?”
Let me first give you the broad answer o these questions.
You can do the most remarkable things, no matter what kinds
of winters lifc throws your way. People can rise to unbelicvable
heights when called upon: A woman lifts a two-ton car to save.
her child; a man survives starvation and disease in a concen-
tration camp because he dreams of seeing his family; immi-
grants start their new lives by washing dishes and within five
years, by scrimping and saving, own their own thriving busi-
nesses with scores of native-born on their payroll. Remarkable!

```
Lalso found out that kids can do remarkable things — that
is if they have remarkable things to do. Just get them away
from the TV and challenge their minds and bodies: they will
grow to be remarkable people. (I've also discovered that if they.
don’t have remarkable things o do, there's no telling what they
will do. But that’s another matter.. .)
```
```
%
```
```
The Miracl of Personal Deyelopment
```
```
Human beings can do remarkable things because they are
remarkable. You and I aren’t amoeba, fish, birds, or dogs. We
can turn nothing into something, pennies into fortune, disaster
into triumph. In contrast, when a dog starts with weeds he ends
up with weeds. The reason? He's just a dog. He doesn't have
the ability to create.
So accept the fact that you are remarkable. Thrive on your
uniqueness! Reach down inside yourself and bring out more of
your remarkably human gifts. They are there, waiting to be
Giscovered and used.
Once you bring out all your gifts, you can change anything
you need to change:
If you don't like how it is for you now, change it
Ifitisn’t enough, change it.
If it doesn't suit you, change it.
If it doesn't please you, change it.
```
```
Remember: YOU CAN CHANGE ALL THINGS FOR
THE BETTER WHEN YOU CHANGE YOURSELF FOR
THE BETTER. After all, you aren’t just a plant or an animal,
completely dependent on instinctive behavior. You are ahuman
being, a most remarkable creation.
‘You and Lare too sophisticated to think that we can change
simply by reading this bit of philosophical insight. It will take
lots more than that. What will it take? Perhaps I should first
tell you what isn' going to do it.
```
```
Some people will tell you: *Enthusiasm makes all the dif-
ference.” We hear a lot about enthusiasm these days. The old
cliche perseveres. In the typical sales meeting one still hears
it being chanted in staccato unison by a chorus of bleary-eyed
salespeople:
“To.be.en.thu.si.as.tic. you.must feel.en. thu.si.as.tic.”
But, you see, enthusiasi by itself won't help. I'm sorry.

are still some things waiting for you to do. And unless you do

them, things simply won't change. A man can get all excited
about lifting two-hundred-pound weights —until he gets to the:
gym. Then he needs a new kind of excitement, long-term ex-
Citement that will keep him in training until he can lift the two
hundred pounds. We call this kind of excitement discipline.
Frankly, disciplinc is the only thing that will do it. It s the
only vehicle for real progress. [fhere is one thing 1o get excited
about, its discipline. Get excited about your ability to do the
necessary things for growth. That's true excitement, not just
hopeful panic.

```
* HOW TO CHANGE *
```
```
No one understands as^1 do the inherent difficulty in chang-
ing old and persistent habits. But habits begin to change when
we begin to change our perceptions
Most of us don't experience a huge cataclysmic transfor-
‘mation. No, for most of us change comes as an evolutionary
process of almost imperceptible changes. We just keep nudging
ourselves in the right direetion, forming one or two better hab-
its here and there, until finally we realize we have turned
around a major area of our life.
```
```
The Three Areas of Personal Development
```
```
In your quest for personal development, there are three
arcas for you to consider: You can look at developing yourself
spiritually, physically, and mentally.

```
Spiritual Self-Development

area. Because I was raised in ahome filled with deep faith (my
father is a preacher, a fact which makes me — for better or for
worse — a PK, or preacher's kid), I was imbued with a love
for God's creation. But regardless of your background (this
book s written for people of all backgrounds and beliefs), I
think you should evaluate what growth and change you want
to make in this vital area. Spiritual and ethical values will help
build a strong foundation underneath your quest for wealth and
happiness.
```
```
Physical Self-Development
```
```
The Bible teaches that we should treat our bodies like tem-
ples. And, indeed, the Jewish laws for hygiene are elaborate
and specific.
But beyond hygiene, I think we need to make a point of
“draping our temple,” dressing in a way thats appropriate to
our desire to succeed.
Let's face it, how we appear to others does make a differ-
ence in terms of our ability to function well in the marketplace.
In fact, there is another biblical phrase that tells us to take care
of the outside for people and take care of the inside for God.
People look on the outside, at least initially, and God looks on
the inside, always.
Now maybe you think people shouldn't judge you by your
personal appearance. Well let e tell you, they do! And be-
cause they do, you should make a point of looking your best.
(There are lots of good books on this subject, 5o check with
your bookstore or library.)
Another aspect of physical development has to do with
staying in shape. The body and mind work together. And for
your mind to have the stamina to strive, your body should be
in as good a shape as possible.
Do you have a regular exercise program? If not, find one

birth to age cighteen our learning curve is dramatic. We learn
4 staggering amount quickly, but as we grow older and find
our niche in the marketplace, our learning curve reaches a
plateau.
In the past, if all you wanted was an average life, this non-
‘growth mentality was acceptable. 1 say was because that’s no
longer true. The last few decades of the twentieth century are
demanding constant growth and learning.
As technology keeps accelerating the pace of change, no
one can simply hold on to a job and expect that job to remain
the same for forty years. The my-grandfather-used-to-work-
here-my-father-works-here-and-now-l-work-here mentality is
dying, killing with it the hopes of those who are not willing to
accept the need to grow and to adapt
On the positive side, can you imagine what you can become
if you keep up an accelerated learning curve throughout your
life? Can you imagine what skills you'll develop, what insights
you'll have?

the consistent effort that only discipline provides, let me give
you a key to discipline.

Start with the litle disciplines and begin to string them
together. Gradually, you'll discover that by tackling many
small disciplines you'l] have mastered a big one.
Lurge you to take ona small challenge, something you can
do right now. And then take on another. After awhile, when
the big challenges come your way you'll be able to handle them
with complete confidence.
Do you want to lose weight? Start by eating your bread
unbuttered.
Do you want t0 go to Europe? Start by setting aside twenty
dollars each week.
Do you want 1o be punctual? Start by getting up a half hour
earlier.
Do you want to make amillion-dollar sale? Start by making
a fifty-dollar sale.
As Robert Schuller says, “Inch by inch everything’s a
cinch.” Butif you never take the small steps, no one, including
yourself, will trust you with the big ones. Don't be like the
man who siruts out of his house determined to straighten out
the profit picture of the corporation when he hasn't even
straightened out his own personal budget. Who is he kidding!
You see, everything affects everything else. Every disci-
pline, or lack of one, affects every other discipline.
Mistakenly, a man says, *“This is the only place where! let
down.”” That cannot be! Every low standard will adversely
affect the rest of your performance. Why? Because doing less
than you are capable of doing creates lack of self-csteem. And
lack of sclf-esteem is the greatest deterrent (o success.

nessman. I can share my ideas and my experiences, but people
have got to motivate themselves.”
It took me a while, but I finally realized that you can't
change others. Lord knows, I've tried.
Once T was managing a group of uninspired salespeople.
Feeling challenged, I'said, “I'm going to make them successful
if it kills me.” Guess what? I almost died.
Good people are found, not changed. Sure, rhey can
change themselves, but you and I can't change them. People
ask me, “How do I recruit good people?” and Ianswer, *You
have to find good people.” That's the best answer I can give.
Here s the first rule of successful management: DON'T

it won't work. All you'll get are unhappy ducks. They won't
soar like cagles. They'll just quack, quack, quack. And then
they'll “poop” on you. T know... I've tried.
Recently a full-page ad for a hotel chain caught my cye.
The headline said, “We don't teach our people to be nice.”
Now rhat got my attention. And in smaller print the ad contin-
ued, “We simply hire nice people.” Wow! What a clever
shorteut!
Motivation is a mystery. Why does one salesperson see a
first prospect at seven in the morning and another salesperson
is just getting out of bed at eleven? I don't know. It's part of
the mysteries of lfe.

a yawn, muttering to himself, “I've heard all this stff before.”
Why is that? Why wouldn’t both be affected the same way?
Another mystery.

How to Achieve Financial

Freedom

Money s an emotional topic, and most of us have ambi-
valent feclings about it. On one hand we want the secuity and
comfortitcan bring; on the other hand we fear financial success
will somehow corrupt our ethics. Certainly, TV and movies
o their parts 10 characterize wealthy people as scheming and
evil. When was the fast time you saw a program that depicted
arich person as the “good guy?"
In religious circles one often hears the Bible misquoted by
well-meaning people. Instead of. “The love of money is the
£oot of all evil,” some people tell us that "Money is the root
ofall evil.” Obviously. it is the complete quotation of the Bible
which is correct. If you make money your love and you pursue
affluence to the exclusion of or at the expense of other values,
you have lost, not won.
However, let us consider this question: If you could do
beter, should you? Within the time you've allocated to gainful
work. shouldn't you try to accomplish the most you can?
1 believe the greatest satisfactions of life come to those of
s who make a habit of doing the best with what we've got. In
fact, doing less than our best has a way of weighing on our
psyche.

Tenged by the seasons. We see the soil and the sun and the rain

and the sced and we fecl them urging us o harness them. It's
as if life and nature are saying, “Do you have the genius to
make something unique of us? We are the raw materials. What
splendid things can you create while you are here?”
Youand I, as creatures of enterprise, shouldn't be reluctant
10 go for it — for high productivity, for the full employment of
our genius, for the full development of our potential in all areas
of our lives — including the area of creating wealth. That is
the essence of life.
Sophisticated people know that it isn't the amount that mat-
ters; it’s doing all that we can do with our God-given abilities
that really counts.
“This last thought — doing all that we can with what we
have — is the essence of a special book. 1’ called, The Richest
Man in Babylon, by George Clayson. It' a small book which
can be read in one sitting, but it covers the basics. I call it, The
Appetizer for the Full Discourse on the Subject of Financial
Independence, and I recommend it to you.

```
Our actions and acquisitions say a great deal about us. They
reveal our philosophy of life, our attitude, knowledge, and
thoughts — even our character. Because the outer always re-
flects the inner, they provide a running commentary on our
ability to weigh and o perceive.
‘There’s even an adage that says, *“What you do speaks so
Toudly, I can't hear what you're saying.
There's no escapingit: Everything is symptomatic of some-
thing. ICs either symptomatic of something right or it's symp-
tomatic of something wrong. That's why it's such a wise policy
not to ignore symptoms. In case something in your life isn't
working as it should, they act as an early-warning system,
proclaiming o anyone willing to listen that something must
change.
For example, you could take a look at your lifestyle in
relation to your income. If you're spending more than you're

making, you may be committing slow financial suicide. Your
next “toy,” purchased on the installment plan, could be no less
than another dose of poison served to you on a silver platter.
Look at what you're doing with your present income. Are
you using it in a wise manner, spending no more than seventy
percent of your total income? Or are you living a few hundred
or a few thousand dollars a month above your earnings? Take
a look at the symptoms before it too late.

suggest that if you had a better plan you would have more
money." This is a statement of major importance! You see, its
not the amount that counts; it's the plan that counts. It's not
how nruch you allocate but how you allocate it.

```
When was the last time someone taught you how our eco-
nomic system works? 1 don't mean in some theoretical textbook
way butin terms of real-lfe, everyday economics? Has anyone
ever told you the wisest way to allocate every dollar you earn?
1 certainly wasn't taught any of this until Mr. Shoaff patiently
took me by the hand and explained it to me.
Real-life economics must be one of the most glaring omis-
sions in our educational system. 1 say this because in my travels

well-educated people — doctors, lawyers, top corporate per-
sonnel, even entreprencurs — who haven't the vaguest notion

As a result of their ignorance, they do not teach this basic
economics to their children. And so, generation after genera-
tion remains ignorant of the miracle that s the free-enterprise
system.
Indulge me, then, as I take time to review how money is

```
Taxes
```
1 realize that the topic of taxes may seem like a strange
place to begin the discussion of creating wealth. And yet
throughout our lives, whether young or old, we must learn the
necessity of paying taxes. And as soon as they have any money.
atall, ourchildren, too, must learn that when they spend money
they immediately become consumers. And all consumers of
goods and services, no matter how young, must pay taxes.
1f a child is only six years old when he first goes o the
store to buy something that costs a dolar, the proprictor will
ask him for an additional six cents. The child may look at the
price tag and ask the proprietor what the six cents is for. This,
is the time t0 offer a full explanation. If he’s going to take six
cents from the child, shouldn't the merchant tell him where it
g0es? After all, it his six cents. The child might ask the
proprictor who keeps it. The merchant would then explain that
it's for taxes, that he doesn’t get to keep it but merely collects
it.
‘The next two obvious questions the child might ask are who
gets it and what's it used for. And with these questions come
very important answers. The child should be told that because
we have all agreed to live together, we call ourselves a society.
And for society to function properly. there are some things we
cannot do for ourselves alone.
For cxample, we cannot cach build a piece of the street.
‘The machinery would be too expensive, and it would take (oo

long to learn how to use it. So we have a government. And a
government is made up of people who do things for us that we
cannot o do not want to do ourselves. Because the streets, the
sidewalks, the police, and the fire department must all be paid
for, we've agreed to add some money cach time we buy some-
thing and give it 10 the government.
Understanding this is important. Our children have to learn
this. We have to lcarn this.
```
```
We then move on to federal taxes. Here is a good way to
explain federal taxes. I call it The Care and Feeding of the
Goose that Lays the Golden Eggs. It's so important to feed the
‘g00se — not to abuse the goose or tear off ts wings — but to
feed and care for.
‘What's that you say? The goose eats 100 much? That's prob-
ably true. But then, don't we all eat too much? If so, let not
one appetite accuse another. If you step on the scales and you're
ten pounds too heavy, you've got to say, * Yes, the government
and | are each about ten pounds too heavy. Looks like we both
cat too much.” No question about it. Every appetite must be
disciplined — yours, mine, and the government’s, Hey, we
could all go on'a diet!
Mr. Shoaff urged me to become a happy taxpayer. Now,
‘must admit it took a while, but I finally did become a happy
taxpayer. Part of this transformation occurred when | began

one to pay his or her fair share.

defense as part of the package. If one is going to enjoy the.
benefits, one should pay a share.
Jesus, the master teacher, gave some clear advice when he
said, “Pay Caesarfirst.” That's pretty clear— pay Cacsar first.
For some reason, he didn’t qualify this statement or take the
time to eriticize the government. All he said was, “Pay Caesar
first.” | don’t think we need a prophet to interpret that one for
us.
Now, before you go out and promptly fire your tax advisor,
letme add this: Don’t pay more than you should. By all means,
take advantage of the incentives. They were given to you as a
reward for channeling your money into areas the government
thinks help the economy.
All I'm saying i that when everything has been computed,
all legitimate deductions have been taken, and you reach that
last line on your income tax form, whatever the amount, pay
it. And pay with happiness, knowing that you're feeding the
zoose that lays the golden egzs — the golden eggs of freedom,
safety, justice, and free enterprise.
Some goose!
Some eggs!
Furthermore, 1 believe everyone should pay — even the
poorest person. | don't care if i’ just one dollar a year. That
would be enough. The point is that everyone should enjoy the
dignity of paying his or her fair sharc.

10 the temple. Some came with large amounts. Others gave
smaller amounts. Finally a little old woman came and carefully
put two pennies in the treasury. Jesus pointed to the woman
and said, “Look at this wonderful woman who gave her two
pennies.” The disciples were puzzled. “Two pennies!” they
exclaimed. “Of all the magnificent donations given here today,
why are you pointing to this poor woman as an example?”

Jesus said, *“You don’t understand, but she gave more than
anyone else.” They said, “Two pennies — more than anyone
else? Explain that to us, Rabbi.” He said, “Yes, for her the
two pennies represented all she had.”
How remarkable!
But let’s examine this story further. Sometimes what is not
told has a more profound lesson than what i told. Consider
what Jesus did not do. He did not take the two pennies out of
the treasury and return them to the old lady, saying, “Here,
old woman, we have observed that you are so poor and so
pitful that we are going o give you back your two pennies.”
What an insult that would have been! She would surely have
said, “What's the matter, aren’t my two pennies good enough?
‘They represent a considerable portion of what I own. Would
you'take away my dignity?” Of course, this scene did not
occur. And therein lies the most profound fesson.

The 70/30 Rule
```
```
After you pay your fair share of taxes, you must learn to
live on seventy percent of your after-tax income. This is i
portant because of the way you'll allocate your remai
thirty percent. The seventy percent you will spend on necess-
ities and luxuries. The thirty percent? Let’s allocate it in the
following ways:
```
```
Charity
```
```
Of the thirty percent not spent, one-third should g (o char-
ity. Charity is the act of giving back to the community that
which you have received in order o help those who need as-
sistance. I believe that contributing ten percent of your after-
tax income is a good amount 1o strive for. (You may choose a
larger or smaller amount — it's your plan.)

```

How to Ackicve Financial Freedom

Some people like 10 give their charity through their church.
or community organization; others prefer to give it individ-
ually. But whether you administer it yourself or give your
money to an institution to administer, be sure to set aside a
percentage of your income for giving.
The act of giving should be taught carly in life. The best
time to teach a child the act of charity is when he gets his first
dollar. Tzke him on a visual tour. Take him on 2 tour of a place
where people are truly helpless so that he learns compassion.
1fa child understands, he won't have any trouble parting with
a dime. Children have big hearts.
‘There is a reason why the act of giving should be taught
when the amounts are small: I’s pretty casy to take a dime out
of a dollar. Butit's considerably harder to give away a hundred
thousand dollars out of a million. You say. “Oh, if I had a
million I'd have no trouble giving a hundred thousand.” I'm
not so sure. A hundred thousand i lot of money. We'd better

comes your way.

Capital Investment

With your next ten percent of your after-tax income you're
going to create wealth. This is money you'll use to buy, fix,
manufacture, or sell. The key is to engage in commerce, even
i only on a part-time basis.
1 believe that everyone in this country should engage in
some form of capitalism. Here, we believe that capital belongs
in the hands of the people.
Communism, on the other hand, teaches that capital be-
Tongs in the hands of the state.
‘This makes for a great contrast. Communism has ltle trust
in the ability of the individual to make wise decisions. Instead.

tries with free enterprise, we believe that the genius resides
with the populace. It's the individual, not the state, who will
come up with innovations for goods and services. The pursuit
of profit is a powerful incentive to create a life of abundance
for everyone.
Sohow doyou go about creating wealth with the ten percent
of your income you set aside for that purpose?
‘There are lots of ways. Let your imagination roam. Take a
close look at those skills you developed at work or through
your hobbies; you may be able to convert these into a profitable
enterprise.
Inaddition. you can alsolearn to buy a product at wholesale:
and sell it for retail. Or you can purchase a picce of property
and improve it. And if you're fortunate enough to
place where you're rewarded for additional productis
can work for more income and use this income to invest in an
ownership position through the purchase of stocks.
Use this ten percent to purchase your equipment, products,

‘The best time to teach capitalism is when a child discovers
that he can make some extra money by making himself useful.

There, isn't that simple? Here is a small example of com-

Mrs. Jones says, “Johnny, I appreciate your coming by. I
think your product is good, but really, to be honest with you, I
have lots of soap.”
“Let me come in and check,” says Johnny, charging for-
ward. (Kids know how to overcome objections. They don't
stand on ceremony.
Mrs. Jones, knowing that her objections are useless, says,
“Okay, I'll be a customer.”
Johnny rushes home excited. He says, "
lars 1o spend.”
“If you spend all three dollars,"” you remind him, “you'll
be out of business."
“Oh,” sighs Johnny, a bit disappointed. *I see what you
mean.”
You g0 on to explain, “First, you must set aside two dollars
1o invest in another botile of soap. You must not spend your
capital. Capital must be carefully preserved. What would you
think of a farmer who ate his seed corn? Dumb farmer, right?
So capital, which is known as seed money, must be defended.
Its your only chance for another harvest.”
Johnny can't argue with your explanation, so after consid-

profit. But I do get 10 spend the dollar profit, don't 12"
Now comes your opportunity to show Johnny the difference
between staying poor and becoming rich. You explain, “If you
spend all your profit, you'll wind up broke and unhappy.”
Johnny doesn't understand. So you take hirm to the poorest
neighborhood in town and you ask him, “Do you want to live

Next. you remind Johnny of the need for charity. Johnny
remembers. “Oh yes. here is ten cents for those who cannot
help themselves. Now can I spend the rest?”
“No, no,"” you reply. *You'lI still wind up broke and just a
little less unhappy.”
“Okay, okay, what now?" Johnny is becoming impatient.
“The next ten cents out of your one-dollar profit s for the
increase of your capital. If you keep setting aside ten cents for
every dollar you make, you'll someday have enough to by
two bottles of soap instead of one."
“Oh, sure.” Now Johnny is really catching on. “If I can
buy two bottles instead of one, I save myself a trip and sell
more bottles.
How clever!
Next, you explain that some companies will charge you less
per bottle when you buy two. If they sell one bottle for two
dollars, they might sell two bottles for three dollars and eighty
cents. Johnny is excited. “Wow!" he exclaims. “When I sell it
1 can even make more profit!*
And it true. Everybody benefits from the increase in cap-
ital. The company gets 1o sell two bottles at a time, Johnny
saves atrip and some costs. and he can keep some ofthe savings
or pass them on to Mrs. Jones as an incentive to buy o bottles
instead of one.
Johnuy says, “Hey, this is neat. Now do I get to spend the
rest of my profit?”
“No we still need to do one more thing. We're going to rent
your money 1o the bank.""
“How does that work?"
So you explain. “Out of your profit you need to take out
ten cents and put it into a financial insiitution. like a bank.
They are going 1o pay you a fee for renting your money. They
call it interest.”

it goes. And if you put another obstacle in its way, the ant will
ook for a way — over, under, or around. How long will an

ant keep trying? Until it dies. An ant will never quit
What a lesson!

‘The second reason ants are unique? Guess what ants plan
for all summer? That's right — winter. And how much will an
ant gather in the summer to prepare for winter? Al it can! How
intelligent!

Do you remember the fable about the grasshopper? He
laughed at the ant for storing grain all summer, while he kept
leaping about the high grass without a care about the future.
‘When the harsh winter came he starved to death while the ant
had plenty.

Rich or poor — the difference is not so much in how much
you make as it is in how you use what you make. The choice

* MID-COURSE CORRECTIONS *
```
```
What do you think of when you think of old people? Do
you see people who are somewhat helpless and who live on
limited resources? Indeed, this is the predominant condition of
the majority of those who fall into the group known as “senior
citizens.”
‘Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could change that image?
I've coune up with a new definition of what grandparents ought
10 be. The major role of grandparents should be to teach their
prandehildren how to be wealthy, cultured, and happy “just
like us.” Grandparents should not have to say, “I've worked
all my life and now I need help." They should be able to say,
“Ive worked all my life; now I can help.”
1f you are not financially independent by age forty or fifty,
it docsn't mean that you live in the wrong country. It doesn't
mean that you live in the wrong community. Nor does it mean
that you live in the wrong time or that you're the wrong person.
It simply means that you have the wrong plan.
And you're far from being alone. Most of us get off course.
When they send a rocket to the moon, they know the rocket
will eventually get a little off course. The first set of guidance
systems will not be cnough for the whole trip. There will be
need for a mid-course correction.
Youand I are no different. From time to time we, t00, must
execute our own mid-course correction if we are to become
financially independent. After all, wouldn't you want to be the
kind of grandparent who can serve as a role model for wealth
and happiness?

* KEEPING SCORE *
```
```
Soon after | met him, Mr. Shoaff asked me if I have a
financial statement. 1 asked, “What is a financial statement?”
```
```
103
```

Mr. Shoaff patiently explained that its very important to know
exactly where you are. without kidding yourself. Only when
you know where you are can you possibly have a good plan
for going forward to where you want to be.
Itisn't hard to do. You merely list the value of your assets
on one side of a piece of paper and the total of what you owe,
or liabilities, on the other side. Then, by subtracting your lia-
bilities from your assets you come up with the number which
constitutes your financial net worth. Now it docsn't tell you
what you're worth s a person, only what you're worth in
monetary terms,
Usaid to Mr. Shoaff, “My financial statement isn’t going
10 look 100 good.” He said. “It’s not important how good it
looks. What is important is that you do it.”
o1 put together my first financial statement. I had lots of
liabilitics. | owed money to my parents. to the finance com-
pany, on my car, and to several other institutions who expected
10 be paid monthly. Now, on the asset side, 1 was scraping. [
put down everything I could think of. I even included my shoes!
After all, they were worth something. Wow, how embarrassing
10 have so little — afier six years of working!
No doubt you're doing much better. But even if you're not,
you need to have a financial statement. You don't have to post
the results on a public bulletin board: it isn't important that
you proclaim it 10 the community. But its incredibly important
that you know the score of your present financial game plan.
‘With your financial statement, start keeping good books
of your income and expenses. Have you ever heard the expres-
sion, “I don't know where it all goes?" Never be the one to
say it. From now on make a point of knowing exactly where it
all goes and where it all comes from.

Hey, 1 found out that just making good money isn’t cnough
I found out that a person can make ten thousand dollars amonth
and still go broke. You say, **How can you go broke making
ten thousand a month?” I’s easy! Just spend eleven thousand.

```

```

And believe me, when you make ten thousand, it's not hard to
spend eleven thousand. As someone once said, “If your outgo
exceeds your income, your upkeep will become your
downfall. "

That's where the seeds of greatness are sown — great wealth,

There is a biblical saying that if you will be faithful to a
few things, you will someday become the ruler over many
things. That's it — that’s the philosophy that couns. Life is
reluctant to hand over fortune and responsibility to someone
who messes up his or her paycheck. But assume responsibility
for keeping score of your financial life and you have taken a
major siep (o be trusted with a life of abundance.

* THE WEALTH-AND-HAPPINESS
ATTITUDE *
```
```
Tused to say, "I hate to pay my taxes.”
Mr. Shoaff said, “Well, you can live that way if you want
{0 — thal’s certainly one attitude.”
1 was a bit perplexed. I thought it was the only attitude to
have. I wondered what he meant
T used to say, *| hate to pay my bill R
And he said, *“Well, you can live that way if you want to.
1 thought it was the only way.
1 used 10 say, 1 hate to part with my money.”
Mr. Shoaff said, “That's one choice for an attitude and
lifestyle.”
```
```
105
```

How 10 Achieve Financral Freedom

Finally, Tasked, “Ts there another way 10 feel about these
things?"
Mr. Shoaff answered, ““Whatif you said, ‘I love to pay my
taxes because | know that it is my part i the care and feeding
of the goose that lays the golden eggs'? What if you said, ‘T
love to pay my bills, reduce my liabilities, and increase my
assets? What if you said, *I love (0 part with my money and
putitinto circulation where it can help build a dynamic econ-
omy"? Wouldn't it be a better way if you leamed to ‘love to0*
rather than *hatc t0'?”
‘Whatan incredible way to look at life! And although it took
me a while 1o learn to say, truthfully, *1 love 1o, the change
inmy life from hating to loving made a tremendous difference.
Mr. Shoaff even taught me to pay my car payments with
enthusiasm. He said, “Next time you pay a hundred dollars on
your installment loan, put a note inside the envelope that says,
*With great enthusiasm I send you this one hundred dollars.” *
‘Smiling broadly, he continued, **You won't believe what a stir
this will cause on the other end. ‘They don’t get many notes
like that. But most important, you won't believe what will
happen on your end. You'll feel in control, carrying with you
a philosophy that brings joy instead of frustration.™

Financial independence? You can achieve it. Why not start
today? Al it takes is the discipline to apply the 70/30 rule to
your life. Young or old, it's never 100 late to get on the right

###### How to Be an Enlightened

Time Manager

A few years ago while on 2 lecture tour in South Africa, |
stumbled across a short essay by Atnold Bennet on the subject
of time. [ liked it so much that I want to share it with you:

```
Time is the inexplicable raw material of everything. With it all
is possible: withou it, nothing. The supply of time is truly a
daily miracle, an affair genuinely astonishing when one cxam-
ines it.
```
```
You wake up in the morning, and lo! Your purse is magically
filled with twenty-four hours of the unmanufactured tissue of
the universe of your life. It is yours. It is the most precious of
possessions.. - no one can take it from you. Itis unstealable.
And no one receives either more or less than you receive.
```
```
In the realm of time, there is no aristocracy of wealth and no
aristocracy of intellect. Genius is never rewarded by even an
extra hour a day. And there is no punishment, Waste your infi-
nitely precious commodity as much as you will and the supply
will never be withheld from you.
```
```
Moreover, you cannot draw on the future. Impossible to get into
debt! You can only waste the passing moment. You cannot waste
tomorrow; it is kept for you.
```
```
109
```

How t0 Be an Enlightened Time Manager

```
Ihave said the affair s a miracle, s it not? You have this twenty-
four hours of daily time 1o live. Out of it you want to spin health,
pleasure, money, contentment, tespect, and the evolution of your
immortal soul.
```
```
s right usc, its most effective use is a matier of the highest
urgency and of the most thrlling actuality. Al depends on tha.
Your happiness — the clusive prize that you are al clutching
for, my friend — depends on that.
```
```
1f one cannot arrange that an income of twenty-four hours shall
exactly cover all proper items of expenditure. one does muddle
one’s whole life indefinitely.
```
```
‘We shall never have any more time. We have, and we have always
had. all the time there is.
```
```
* THE FOUR ATTITUDES TOWARD THE
MANAGEMENT OF TIME *
```
```
Time is the most precious commodity we have. Therefore,
how we manage it has the most profound effect on how our
lives turn out. Every one of us has developed an attitude about
time, whether we are conscious of this or not. This attitude
determines the approach a person takes toward his or her al-
lotment of time.
‘There are four separate attitudes about time. Each creates
a distinetly different lifestyle:
```
```
The Drifter Mentality
```
```
Drifters ignore the subject of time altogether. They choose.
tokeep their lifestyle as unstructured as possible. They let their

```
```
lives meander aimlessly, like tumbleweed in a light desert
wind, enjoying the uncertainty and spontaneity that accom-
panies such a lfe.
If they hold a job its usually a temporary one because they
rebel against any structure, any atempt to haness time. The
typical drifter will say, “I've been late all my life. I can't ever
scem 10 get a handle on my time. The heck with it! I'l just
takeiteasyand get whereI'm going when I'm good and ready.”
Anything wrong with this atitude? Who am I to say? It's
your life. But if you find yourself attracted to this mode of
living, consider that this attitude of drifting along the highways
and byways of lfe will stand in the way of any chance for real
progress. You can’t drift your way 10 a better life.
```
```
‘The Nine-to-Five Time Manager
```
```
Another group of people, perhaps the majority, has adopled
an autude about time that falls somewhere between the drifter
and the workaholic. These people seem to function best with
a moderate level of stress. They can handle only so many
projects at one time. They like to have their evenings frec —
1o “smell the flowers™ all through lfe.
A man works for a company, then decides to own his own
business. But as his responsibilities mount, as he sees how he
‘must come to work before anyone else and leave long after the
janitor has left, he thinks, I would rather work for someone
clse. Let them have all the glory and the headaches.”
Is he wrong? Of course not — not if his only two options
are either working around the clock o working in a nine-to-
five job. (You'll soon see, when we discuss the fourth attitude
about time, these are not his only options.) When he tried to
fun his own company, he exceeded the maximum level of time
commitment he can handle comfortably. And 50, he decides
10 walk away from the challenge, convinced that for him the
price for success is 100 high.
```

```
How 10 Be an Enlightened Time Manager
```
Not everyone can handle the high price of success. Not
‘only s this true in running an independent business, it's equally
true of many corporate executives | know. Here's astory which
illustrates that some people should put imits on the price they
pay:
A little girl asks her mother, “Why doesn't Daddy play
with me? He comes home from work, and right away he goes
10 his den. And as soon as dinner is over. he’ off to do some
‘more work. I want to play with my daddy. Doesn’t he love me.
anymore?”
So Mom, fighting back tears of her own loneliness and
pain, tries to explain, **Honey, your daddy is very busy. He
loves you very much, and that is why he works so hard. He
has so much work to do at his office that he has to bring some
of ithome.”
“The little girl thinks for 2 moment about what her mother
just told her. Suddenly, her eyes brighten and she says, “Well.
if he can't get all his work done at the office. why don't they
just put him in a slower group?”
Why not, indeed! There’s a limit a person should pay for
financial and career success. And that limit comes when other
important values are sacrificed at the altar of material success.
1know .... I, too, went after some things in my life. only
0 find out later that I paid too much. Had | known how much
they were going to cost before I began, I never would have paid
the high price.

```
‘The Workaholic
```
```
‘The old-fashioned concept of success, as typified by Willy
Loman in Death of a Salesman. is the kind which keeps a
person working longer and harder. For the workaholic there is
never enough work. He or she works ten, twelve, fourteen
hours a day. The workaholic will take two jobs, working them
back toback. Satisfaction only comes when slecp s fought off,

```

```
```

```
enjoyment is denied, and more tasks are finished.
We all know the results of this kind of behavior. While
often eliciting admiration from outsiders, the workaholic’s be-
havior can result in the alienation of family, loss of health, and
eventually a crisis of values
Tronically, the workaholic is not always the one who makes
the most money. That's because he o she s often more task-
oriented than results-oriented.
```
```
If 1 had to choose between the three attitudes about time
which I have so far described, 1 would be hard-pressed to
choose the superior one. But fortunately there is one other
attitude about time which 1 consider ideal:
```
```
The Enlightened Time Manager
```
```
‘The fourth and most enlightened approach to time borrows
from the other three. The enlightened time manager allots time
for every aspect of his life. He even allots time for drifting, by
scheduling time (o do nothing. Like the nine-to-five person,
he knows (o limit the hours of work and to have quality time
for other important values, such as family. And like the wor-
Kaholic, he would never be afraid to work long hours — but
only when necessary.
What makes the enlightened time manager enlightened is
his ability to schedule himself to work only somany hours and
still get more done than the workaholic. How does he do that?
imply by working smarter, not always longer — by focusing
onmore productivity per hour instead of putting in more hours.
Enlightencd time managers look for new ways to multiply
their productivity. In other words, they develop wealth by the
use of leverage.
Leverage allows you to multiply your resources many
over. For example, you can leverage money by borrowing wis-

ely to purchase real estate or to build a business. You can
leverage time by muliplying your efforts through the recruit-
ment of an expanding sales force or by delegating less pro-
ductive work to competent employecs.
```
```
* THE MASTERY OF TIME *
```
Here's a key to understanding the management of time.
Either you run your day or your day will run you. It really a
‘matter of deciding to be in charge. You see, it’s much too casy
1o relinquish control, to hand over the reins of authority and
1ose the ability to direct time.
One of the best ways to start regaining control of our time
is to learn the most effective time-management word. Do you
know what it is? The word is “no.” Leam to say “no.”
1 still have difficulty with this one. It so easy to say yes
10 everything — 10 be a “nice” person. The result of saying
yes is that we spend long hours trying to get ourselves out of
obligations we never should have agreed 10 in the first place.
It's one of the great time-wasters.
I finally learned to say no nicely. How? This is what 1 do.
Usay: “No, | don't think I can. But if that changes, I'll give
youa call.” Now isn't it better to call people with good news.
and let them know you can do it after all? Try it, it works! A
friend of mine, Ron Reynolds, is fond of saying, “Don’t let
your mouth overload your back.”

Another way to regain control of your day is this: When
you work, work; and when you play, play. Mixing the two never
works. Al you end up doing is cheating yourself both ways.
If you work and play at the same time, you'll miss the joy that
comes from great accomplishment and the complete release
that is the gift of pure play.

a potentially wonderful time by thinking “work” during
playtime.
Talso used to do the opposite. I'd say, “I'm going to take
off at three to ride my motorcycle on the back roads.” Guess
what I'd be thinking about for the rest of the day? That’s right,
riding on the back roads.
Now when 1 go on a lecture tour to Spain, Africa, or Aus-
tralia, I make it a work trip. Every day is filled with lectures,
interviews, and conferences. But once my business obligations
are over, I take time to play, to explore, to enjoy. It's been a
valuable lesson.

A friend of mine, a successful builder, has created a sched-
ule of working a week and taking off a week. He calls it his
‘work-a-week-play-a-week plan. In reality, when you count the
weekends, he really plays for nine days and works for five
days. Quite a luxury, right? However, let me tell you this:
During those five days, he works; he really works. You can't
believe the whirlwind of activities he creates. The dust really
lies as secretaries, accountants, architects, and superintend-
ents meet with him hour upon hour. His five days are made up
of maximum effort. He goes all out, nonstop. Then he shuts
everything off and leaves to play with his family. Amazing!

Find out when you are at your most energetic. If you are most
productive early in the morning, take advantage of this by
scheduling your biggest projects as the first order of the day.

range to schedule appointments over breakfast
Butif the opposite is true for you and you have a hard time
remembering your name until lunch time, schedule your most
demanding business activities for the afternoon and evening
Next, analyze your habits. For example, if you're not good

‘yourself for years to keep better records and balance the check-
book and you still haven't done it —accept it, and get someone:

A few years ago my staff came to the conclusion that I am
a poor courier. Because I travel constantly, they would often
ask me to deliver documents to people in the city to which I
was going. “Sure, no problem,” I'd reply as I absentmindedly
put the papers in my coat pocket. | recall several times hearing
about these undelivered documents from my dry cleaners...
After awhile, my staff approached me as if I were a five-
year-old. On one occasion they said, *This document has to
20 to New York. Wil you be sure to deliver it shis time?"" |
id, “Of course. You can count on me. Hey, I'm not flaky."
Needless to say, the document was stil in my briefcase when
1 returned.
So now the word is out. Every new employee is indoctri-
nated by my staff: “Don’t give the chairman anything to de-
liver. He's good at alot of things, but he’s a poor courier. Make
other arrangements.”
And that's my point. There is nothing shameful about ad-
‘mitting that you aren't good at everything — as long as you

‘The Telephone
```
```
We have all learned to take the telephone for granted. It's
50 common today that instead of having one in every home,
we now have a phone in every room and, soon, there will be
one in every car. And yet, few of us have taken the time to
analyze how 10 use the telephone for maximum effectiveness.
“Thus, we need to recognize that while it has incredible potential
for efficiency, the telephone also can be one of the most dis-
ruptive time-wasters in our lives.
You see, just as the telephone is a remarkable tool for you,
itis also a remarkable tool for everyone clse. Just as you have
the ability to reach others in seconds, so do others have the
ability to reach you instantly. This reality can play havoe with
any daily plan or routine.
Therefore, make sure the telephone is there primarily for
your convenience. Gain control over who can reach you and
when. If you have the luxury of having a seeretary, train him
or her to’sereen your phoné calls effectively. Or use an an-
swering machine so that you can return phone calls at your
convenience.
Remember, also, that the telephone allows others to control
your time, even at home. That means that unless you're careful,
others can also intrude on your family and leisure time. Don't
letthat happen. During social times with friends or family, find
away 1o avoid answering the telephone. You can use an an-
Swering service. an answering machine, or you can simply pull
out the plug. Your family and friends are too important to have
the ever-insistent ringing of the telephone monopolize the time
You've reserved for them.
In addition to controlling your incoming phone calls, there
```
```
ur
```

How to Be an Enlighiened Time Manager

```
is a simple way to better manage your outgoing calls: Have an
agenda. All of us waste time and money on inefficient phone
conversations. Have you ever heard yourself saying, “Let's
see, there was something else I wanted to talk with you about.
1 just can't think of it right now. I'll have to call you back?
We've all said that at one time or another. It a great time-
‘waster, and it also appears unprofessional.
Solution? Before every phone call write down the key
points you want to cover. It will make each conversation more.
effective, shorter, and more professional. It will also give you
a record of each call.
‘Should you have to recall a telephone conversation, you'll
have the information in front of you. For example, you can say,
“John, how are you doing on those four things we talked about
the other day?” And should John reply, “What four things? We
didn’t talk about that,” you can calmly show John your writien
record of your conversation.
```
```
Time-Effective Organization
```
```
We all do things as a result of long-standing habits. This
becomes awasteful luxury, however, when we want to be more.
efficient. So take the time to analyze your work procedures. Is
your filing method up-to-date? What about your bookkeeping?
Today there are many efficient ways to increase productivity
through electronic means. Our age has brought with it tremen-
dous possibilities for processing more information faster. You
might want to take advantage of some of them.
Inmy office | have a computer that can do the most amazing
things and save a great deal of time. In addition, 1 also have a

neighbors. So do analyze carefully how to use these new clec-
tronic tools. And if your business is more sophisticated, have
an expert help you. Remember, you don't need to be good at
everything if you have others cover your weaknesscs.

Asking the Right Questions
```
```
When managing people, one of the greatest time-savers is
asking questions — more specifically, asking the right ques-
tions. In behavioral psychology we learn that cverything is a
result of something else. And when a problem arises, it is
usually a clue that a deeper problem lics beneath the surface.
‘The best way to get to the bottom of things is to not jump
t0 conclusions but to ask questions...
1f Mary isn't making sales we could say, “Okay, we need
10 give Mary a lecture about making sales.” Or maybe we
should ask her supervisor, “Why isn't Mary making sales?”
The supervisor might say, “She isn’t making enough calls."
So we dig further. *“Why isn't she making enough calls?” And
we are told, “It's because she doesn't start her day early
enough.” 1 suppose we could stop here and try to motivate
Mary to start earlier. But, instead, we ask one more question,
““Why isn't Mary starting her day earlier?” Now, we've finally
gotten o the heart of the issue. Perhaps Mary is having a
personal problem. Perhaps it's not her sales skills that need
improvement
‘The real causes to important problems are usually buried
several layers decp. By becoming good at asking the right
questions you can save yourself enormous time by getting to
the root of problems a lot faster.

* FOUR WAYS OF THINKING ON PAPER *
```
```
One of the greatest taols for successful time management
s having the ability to think on paper. Building a successful
enterprise is like building a house. You visualize the ideas, put
them on paper, and execute them. In my company we have a
saying: OPERATE FROM DOCUMENT NOT FROM
THOUGHT.
Building a day also requires thinking on paper. It's just
about over when a person wakes up in the morning and says,
“Let's see, what shall 1 do today?” It 100 late. About the best
thing that person can do is take the rest of the day off and start
planing the next day, the next week, the next month.
‘Thinking on paperis acreative process. There is much more
1 it than just making a “to do” ist. In fact, there are four
different but essential methods that you should use t plan your
life:
```
```
Your Journal
```
```
In my lectures and intensive seminars | spend a great deal
of time promoting the use of journals. 1 do so because it's my.
conviction that they are invaluable tools for the serious students
of successful living.
A journal is a gathering place for all the good information
and wisdom that comes your way. Good ideas can originate
from almost anywhere. Perhaps you may hear a particularly
‘meaningful sermon. Or you may read a bit of information you
can use. You might even think of a great idea while driving.
“The point is: DON'T LET GOOD IDEAS ESCAPE YOU.
A great idea can change your life — if you capture it. Have a
journal with you at all times, no matter where you are.

One of the best ways 1o stay in control i 10 get a project
book — a ring binder with tabs in. If you're working with
people, allot a separate section in your binder to cach individ-
ual. Under cach person’s tab, keep all pertinent information
about him or her. Note each person's performance, family his-
tory, goals, strengths, needs, or anything else you consider
relevant. Asa manager, you may also want to have information
such as sales records or performance charts. This way, should
you need to evaluate performance, you have conerete, usable.
information.
Now, depending on your particular business or profession,
youmay also want to “tab"” cach office o department. Or you
‘may want to categorize items project by project — that's up to
you. The key is to centralize all data so that you can focus on
itwithout having to spend wasted hours hunting for information
in countless forgotten files.
‘This concept of having a project book will lso work for
your personal affairs
For example, you can “keep tabs” on cach one of your
children, Does keeping information about your children sound
a bt cold? Then let me ask you: Do you remember your child’s
latest report card? 1f so, how does it compare to the one before?
‘What event did your child ask you to atiend? Do you have it
written down? Remember the last meaningful one-to-one con-
versation the two of you had? What was your child’s main
concern?
You see, children remember all interactions with their par-
ents. Unfortunately, we as parents are often preoccupied and
inattentive. Keeping a sparate section on cach child can al-
ways remind us of the essentials.

Naturally, your personal financial affairs will also bencfit
from this system by allowing you to refer at a glance to all your
investments, insurance policies, and the like.
```
```
Now, do you really need a journal or a project book to get
by? Of course not! If all you want is to get by, none of this
really matters. But for those of you on the journcy to wealth
and happiness, these techniques can accelerate your progress
beyond belief.
```
```
A Calendar
```
```
Another method of organizing your thoughts on paper is
by using a daily calendar. Now when 1 talk about a calendar I
don’t mean the kind that barely gives you enough space to write
in your appointments. The kind I mean is called a “Day-
Timer.” (Day-Timers is also the name of the company.) The
Day-Timer is a daily log of your appointments and schedules.
But it’s a lot more. It has a place to keep track of business
expenses, meeting results, phone conversations, and “to do”
lists.
Your Day-Timer can also be used as a gathering place for
those daily or weekly highlights you wish to log into your
journal or project book. Think of it as the central location from
which you process all your information of the day, the week,
the month, and even the year.

A Game Plan

fespect 1o how your game of life turns out. The term “game
plan” is ironic because, even though we seem to understand

basketball game, few of us take the time to make a game plan
for our lives.
Here's the first and most important rule for your life’s game
plan: DON'T START YOUR DAY UNTIL YOU HAVE IT
FINISHED. Because each day is a priceless mosaic in your
lifetime strategy for wealth and happiness, alweys plan your
day before you start. And do it every day. Yes, I know, all this
writing can be tedious. But remember, value is the fruitful
result of effort, not of hope
Once you have mastered the art of planning your day, every
day, you are ready to gradute to the next level of higher suc-
cess. The next key is: DON'T START THE WEEK UNTIL
YOU HAVE IT FINISHED.
Plan your week before you start it. Imagine what your life
will be like if you ask yourself on Sunday night, “What do I
want to accomplish this week?” Yes, I know, it's a bit of a
stretch, butif you learn to plan your days as part of your overall
‘game plan for the week, all the parts will fit much betier. As
aresult, cach day will be that much more effective.
Once you master your planning for a week, you are able to
plan your life one month at a time. Therefore, the next key is:
DON'T START YOUR MONTH UNTIL IT’S FINISHED.
By following this rule, your weeks and days become part
of a bigger design. You are developing a long-term view of
your life, gaining greater perspective, because you are now
planning.
And you'll be learning to coordinate your daily, weekly,
and monthly goals with your three-month, six-month, and one-
year goals.
Hey, it's going to take great discipline on your part. But
when you accomplish this, you will be called a master. It may
be a “high road” to the mastery of time, but I'm sure you'll
enjoy the view, the taste, and the company of other masters
like you!

* HOW TO PREPARE A GAME PLAN *
```
There are two things you should understand about creating
game plans. First, a game plan acts like a spread sheet, but

instead of listing numbers, it lsts activities. Second, you can
use the game-plan technique for cither a single project or a
variety of concurrent projects.
Here's how it works: On a sheet of graph paper make ver-
tical columns of the number of days this plan is to cover. Then,
on the left side of the paper make a heading called “activities.”
Under this heading list all the activities to be performed within
that time frame.
For example, let’s say you're working on launching a cam-
‘paign for a new product. For each activity required (sales con-
ferences, advertising support, packaging, market research),
determine the deadline that must be met and plot iton the spread
sheet. Then calculate the days it will take to accomplish the
task and block them on your game-plan sheet. The final result
s a clear visual presentation of the tasks before you.
‘Game plans are frustrating to create. You may tear up sev-
eral before producing the perfect one. But they are frustrating
only because you're finding it difficult to prioritize all your
projects. However, once you put your game plan together you
will enjoy an enormously satisfying fecling.
Keep your game plan where you can see it. Display it on
your office wall or in your project book. It will serve as a
constant reminder of the tasks at hand.
Game plans are both exciting and painful. They are painful
because they keep reminding you o get on with your plans.
They are also painful when you fall behind schedule. But they
are exciting, too, because you see the magic of dreams and
plans turning into reality. This is immensely rewarding. The
feeling you get is not unlike that of a great artist surveying a
completed canvas. It's the incredible feeling of being incharge.

The Principle of Association

One of the major influences shaping the person you want
10 be s also one of the least understood. It is your association
with others — the people you allow into your life. Have you
ever thought about how others shape your lfe? The thought
didn't even occur to me until Mr. Shoaff said, “Jim, never
underestimate the power of influcnce.”
OF course he was right. The influence of those around us
is s0 powerful, 50 subtle, so gradual that often we don't even
realize how it can affect us.
Think about t. If you're around people who spend all their
income, chances are excellent that you will become a spendth-
rift, 1f you're around people who go to more wrestling games
than concerts, you're likely 1o join in with them. Such is the
power of peer pressure.
Butit goes even further. If you're around people who think
it's all right to cheat a little, you, 100, might be persuaded to
cuta few corners. People can really nudge you off course until
one day, ten years down the road, you wake up asking yourself,
““How did I get here anyway?”
And that's not a very happy moment...

```
To avoid wasting time with the wrong crowd you need to
ask yourself three fundamental questions:
```
1. With whom do I spend time?

```
19
```

The Principle of Asociation

2. What are they doing to me?
3. Ts this association okay with me?

Don’t dismiss these questions. Take a look at the time you
spend with each of your major associates. Is it positive and
constructive o is it negative and destructive?
Not sure? Then think about these things:

```
® What have they got you doing?
What have they got you listening to?
© What have they got you reading?
® Where have they got you going?
© What have they got you thinking?
How have they got you talking?
© How have they got you fecling?
© What have they got you saying?
```
Finally, after you have really pondered these, ask yourself
this one final question: Are my present associations helping
me grow in the direction I have chosen through goal-setting?
1f you are fortunate enough to answer yes to this question, I'm
happy for you. But if you are not 5o sure, then it's time to
evaluate your relationships with some of the key players in
your life.
1t soeasy todismiss this question of influence. The *guy”
says, “Ilive here, but it doesn’t matter. I'm around these peo-
ple, but they don’t bother me.” Well, he’s wrong. Everything
matters! This is a good phrase to remember: EVERYTHING
MATTERS.
“This book is different from many others because it deals
with reality, not wishful thinking. In fact, one of the main
purposes of this book is to get you to say: “The days of kidding
myself are over. I really want to know what I have become and
what I am becoming. 1 want to know what my strengths and
weaknesses are, what has power over me, whats influencing

me, what I've allowed to affect my life.”
So take a look and then another. Everything worthwhile
deserves a second look, especially the power of influence.
```
```
Perhaps you've heard the story about the litle swallow
It was covering one eye with its wing and crying bitterly.
An owl flew by and asked, “Little bird, what's wrong?” The
swallow pulled away its wing and showed a gash wherc once
ithad an eye. “Now [ understand,” hooted the owl, blinking,
“You're crying because the crow pecked out your eye!”” “No,”
replied the bird sadly, “I'm not erying because the crow pecked
out my eye; I'm crying because 1 fet him.”
```
```
Is there someone who is pecking away at your vision? Is
there anyone who trics to blind you from secing your dreams?
Hey, it’s casy to let influences shape our lives, especially neg-
ative influences. It's easy to let associations determine our
direction, to let persuasion overwhelm us, to et tides overtake
us, and 10 let pressures mold us. The question is, is this what
‘you want?
Are you becoming, achieving, and acquiring what you
want, or are you letting others steal your dreams?
```
```
* DISASSOCIATION *
```
```
I after analyzing your present relationships you determine.
that you have some weeds in your garden of association, there.
are a couple of things you can do.
First, you can separate yourself from those people who are
destructive to your well-being. I adit this is a tough thing to
do. especially if ts a family member. But if you have someone
who finds a great deal of pleasure in trying to peck away at
Your dreams, goals, or belicfs, get rid of his or her influence.
131
```

Remember, it could be the choice that saves the quality of your
life.
Of course life is rarely that simple. Sometimes we find
ourselves having (o spend time with unpleasant people — co-
‘workers, business associates, and others. In those circumstan-
ces where you cannot fully disassociate yourself, try limited
association.
‘There are also those situations where superficially pleasant
associations can have a long-term negative effect on our lives.
If you spend two nights a week drinking with your buddies,
‘your life may eventually spin dangerously out of balance. The
consequences five, ten, twenty years from now can be
devastating,
Its easy to remain mediocre. All you need o o is spend
‘major time on minor things with minor people. Sophisticated
people weigh their actions. They know what a major is and
‘what aminor is. They don’toften get confused by such things
Of course, sophisticated people do have casual friends. The
ifference is that instead of spending a great deal of time with
them, they spend relaxed, relatively unimportant time with
them. They just don’t squander their time on minor friendships
and *good-time Charleys.”

It your life. You can spend your time with whomever you
want and however you want. But 1 don't think you invested in
this book for me to humor you. You must take a look at your
priorities and values, including yourassociations, and evaluate
them. Your time on this earth is too short to spend it less than
wisely.

MORE TIME WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE. Who are those
right people? That depends on your goals and objectives. But
‘generally look for people of substance and culture — people
who spend time reflecting on the meaning of life and who
accomplish great things through discipline and perseverance.
‘That’s what Mr. Shoaff advised me shortly after we met.
He said, “If you truly want success, you've got to get around
the right people.” And then, with a wry look he added, “Of
course, in your present circumstances you'll have to plot and
scheme to do that.” And that was true! I did have to plot and
scheme to get around the right peaple.
During those early days, when called upon to give a sales
presentation, I would frequently park my disintegrating jalopy-
‘minus-muffler several blocks away. Invariably someone would
ask me, “By the way, Jim, how did you get here?” — to which
T would respond, *Oh, someone dropped me off."” Of course,
thatsomeone was me dropping myselfoff in my noisy “bomb.”
It really not all that difficult to associate with successful
people. Just get involved in your community. I have a friend
who started a sales business. She then joined her town’s cham-
ber of commerce, became active on a few committees, and
before she knew it found herself invited to play tennis with
some of the city’s more influential people. You see, it's not so
hard to create new associations.
Also, as we discussed in an earlier chapter, make an in-
vestment in a rich person’s appetite. Take a rich person out for
ameal. There’s no telling what you can learn in an hour or two
of wealth-oriented talk.
In expanding your associations, take a look at your life’s
priorities. Its called associating with a purpose.
For example, find some successful people to help you with
Your success plan; find some healthy people to encourage you
To have an exercise and nutrition plan; find someone who
knows how to live 1o teach you the secrets of a rewarding
lifestyle. And don’t be embarrassed about cultivating the

friendships of these people. Most successful people love to
share their knowledge with others. (It's probably why they e
successful in the first place.)
Successful people seck out those they admire. They un-
derstand that inspiration and knowledge can be gained from
the right type of association. I am no exception to this rule. T
have such an association, a person with whom I like to spend
as much time as possible. He's a big-game hunter, a million-
aire, a traveler, and an entreprencur. He's also one of the
world's great philosophers.
My friend has many skills, but two are positively
uncanny...
First, he has the ability to absorb a day’s events in minute
detail. Not only does he remember each day, I believe he can
also remember every day of his adult life. He is able to recall
every book he’s ever read. He seems to retain every fact he
learns. If 1 had a choice of going to a foreign country myself
or having him visit and recount his trip to me, I would almost
choose the latter. Why? Because he doesn't miss anything that's
important. He absorbs every event like a sponge.
His second talent is his expressiveness. When he returns
from a trip, he describes in vivid detail the sounds and colors
of the country, the customs and concerns of its people, the
‘minor experiénces and the major happenings of his journey.
He can put all that he saw, touched, and felt into exciting,
vibrant words.
As he recounts a trip his listeners can feel the crash of the
waterfall, the cool brecze of the northern winds, the colors and
smells of the cities and the countryside. What a gift he gives
those of us privileged to know him!
What value can one put on such a unique association? [
don't know, but T can say with confidence that from our as-
sociation I've expanded my knowledge, my perception, my
skill, my enterprise, and my lfestyle many times over.

Today, thanks to Guicnberg, Marconi, and other pioneers
in the field of recording information, we can also associate
across the seas and throughout the centuries. Perhaps you can't

Reading my thoughts, Mr. Shoaff smiled and said, “Jim,
there are some people who have beautiful things surrounding
them, and yet they feel little happiness; others have hoarded
huge sums of money and yet are poor in spirit and find little
joy in their lives. 1 want you to learn the art of designing a

“Well,” I replied, “I can think about this when | actually

“No, Jim,” he said, shaking his head, “its easier to lcam

1t really not so hard to learn the art of living. Even people
with modest means can experience a sophisticated lifestyle.
They simply save up some of their soda money for a bottle of

theater. Or by saving up their money all year they have enough

Don't spend all your money a quarter at a time. Save up

Remember, all that candy money canadd up toa small fortune.
And for a sophisticated person, quality is far more important
than quantity. Better a few treasures than a house full of junk.
Lifestyle, as 1 define it here, is a matter of awareness,
values, education, and disciplined taste. It is an art that brings
joy as it’s practiced. It the deliberate decision to savor and
enjoy all the experiences and possibilities of life.

and everyone with whom you come in contact.

By now you know I have a healthy respect for the value of

make you a terror. And if you're inclined to drink a little too
‘much, more money will only enable you to waste yourself in
booze.
“On the other hand, if you master the art of lifestyle and
happiness, more money will help youto amplify your happiness
and inner wealth.”
Lifestyle is style over amount. And style is an art — the
art of living. You can’t buy style with money. You can't buy
good taste with money. You can only buy more with money.
Lifestyle is culture — the appreciation of good music,
dance, art, sculpture, literature, and plays. I’ a taste for the
fine, the unique, the beautiful.
Mortimer Adler, the philosopher, said, “If we don't go for
the higher tastes, we will settle for the lower ones.”
So remember the quest. It to have the best in the time
available to us. 10’ not the amount, it the vale.
Lifestyle also means rewarding excellence wherever you
find it by not taking the small things of life for granted. Let
me illustrate this with a personal anccdote:

```
My lady friend and 1 were on a trip to Carmel, California,
for some shopping and exploring. On the way we stopped at a
service station. As soon as we parked our car in front of the
pumps, a young man, about eighteen or nineteen, came bounc-

“Yes,” I answered. A full tank of gas, please.”

gt to meet nice people like you.”
‘This kid was really something!
1 said, “We're on our way to Carmel and we want to get
some milkshakes. Can you tell us where we can find the nearest
Baskin-Robbins?"
“Baskin-Robbins is just a few blocks away, " he said as he
gave us exact directions. Then he added, “Don’t park out front
" park around to the side so your car won't get sideswiped.”
What a kid!
As we got to the ice cream store we ordered milkshakes,
except that instead of two, we ordered three. Then we drove
back to the station. Our young friend dashed out to greet us.
“Hey, I see you got your milkshakes.”
“Yes, and this one is for you!”
His mouth fell open. “For me?"
“Sure. With all the fantastic service you gave us, I couldn't
Ieave you out of the milkshake deal.”
“Wow!” was his astonished reply.
As we drove off I could see him in my rear-view miror
just standing there, grinning from ear to ar.

Now, what did this litile act of generosity cost me? Only
about two dollars. (This number has a way of cropping up,
doesn'tit?) You sce, it's not the money, it's the style.

```
1 must have been feeling especially creative that day. On
ourarrival in Carmel 1 drove directly 0 a flower shop. As we
‘walked inside 1 said to the florist, “I need a long-stemmed rose
for my lady to carry while we go shopping in Carmel.”
The florist, a rather unromantic type, replied, “We scll
them by the dozen.”
“Idon’t need a dozen,” I said, “just one.”
“Well, he replied haughtily, it will cost you two
dollars.”
“Wonderful,"” 1 exclaimed. *“There’s nothing worse thana
cheap rose.”

Your Road 1o Richer Lifetyle

Selecting the rose with some deliberation, I handed it to
my friend. She was so impressed! And the cost? Tio dollars.
Just two dollars. (A bit later she looked up and said, “Jim, 1
must be the only woman in Carmel today carrying a rose.”)

Besides the two-quarter lesson, Mr. Shoaff taught me an-
other lesson about tipping. He explained to me that the term
“tip” comes from the words “to insure promptness.”

“Now,” he said, “if a tip is meant to insure promptness,
when should one tip?”
1 knew what he was driving at, but 1 was still thinking
“average.” “When you have a meal and the service is good,
you'leave a tip. If you get lousy service, no tip,” was my reply.
“No, Jim, you don’t understand. Sophisticated people
don’t take a chance on good service. They insure good service
by giving the money up front.”
“Tryit. The next time you have aspecial meal ata restaurant,
ask the waiter o waitress to come to your table, put your arm
on his or her shoulder, and say, “Here’s five dollars. Would
you take good care of me and my friend?”
As Mr. Shoaf said, **You won't believe what will happen.
They will hover over your table. You won't have to wonder
where they went or wait for a second cup of coffee.”
Are you getting the message? Same money, different style.

* LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP *

Living life in style also means living a life of balance. And
one of the most important ingredients of a balanced life is
having someone to love and love you. If you have someone you

Next t0 love, friendship is most important. It's priceless.
Friends are those wonderful people who know all about you
and still like you. Friends are those people who come in when
cveryone else is leaving. And because life offers no guarantees,
be sre, on the way up, to make the kinds of friends who will
take you in on the way down. Life has both ups and downs,
and friends, true friends, will make the ups more exhilarating
and the downs less devastating.

satisfaction, and possessions without joy?
You can become a person of culture who adds 1o the whole

The Day That Turns

Your Life Around

```
We have come a long way together. In this book, I have
shared a feast of ideas with you — strategics that are surc o
satisfy your appetite for wealth and happiness. And yet, [ must
also share with you a concern.
You see, if you assimilate al the information in ths book,
you could probably call yourself an expert on the principles of
ealth and happiness. Why, you could no doubt even give a
lecture onthe philosophical aspects of success and sound pretty
impressive at that.
But you must do more in life than know the theory of how
things are supposed to work. In the frec enterprise system you
‘must act to make things happen. Only applied knowledge
counts.
So how do you go about bridging the gap between knowl-
edge and action? Is there a third component that acts as
catalyst? Fortunately, there is. It is our cmotions.
```

* EMOTIONS *

Emotions are the most powerful forces inside us. Under the
‘power of emotions human beings can perform the most

(as well as the most barbaric) acts. To a great degree civili-
zation itself can be defined as the intelligent channeling of
‘human emotion. Emotions are the fuel and the mind is the pilot
which together propel the ship of civilized progress.
‘Which emotions cause people to act? There are four basic
ones; each or a combination of several can trigger the most
incredible activity. The day that you allow these emotions to
fuel your desire is the day you'll turn your life around.

Disgust

One usually does not equate the word "disgust” with pos-
itive action. And yet properly channeled, disgust can change
aperson's life.
“The person who feels disgust has reached a point of no
rewrn. He or she is ready to throw down the gauntlt at life
itself and say, “I've had "
“That's what I said after my humiliating experience with the
Girl Scout and her two-dollar cookies. “I've had it!” 1 said.
“Idon’t want o live like this a-ny-more. I've had it with being
broke. I've had it with being embarrassed, and I've had it with
Iying.
Yes, productive feclings of disgust come when a person
says, “Enough is enough.” Period.

```
‘The *guy” has finally had it with being a loser. He's had
it with mediocrity. He's had it with those awful sick feelings of
fear, pain, and humiliation. He sees his wife walking once more:
through the canned-goods aisle of the supermarket to buy a
can of beans, and he knows what's going to happen. He knows
she will look at the brand that costs sixty-nine cents and the
brand that costs sixty-seven cents. And he knows that although
she prefers the sixty-nine-cent brand, she will buy the one for
sixty-seven cents. And he knows, all too well, the reason she

will buy the cheaper can — t0 save two cents. Two cents! Our
“guy,” sick inside, says: “I've had it with being on my knees
in the dust looking for pennics. We are not living like this
a-ny-more.”
Look out! This could be the day that turns a life around.
Call it what you will — the “I've had it” day, the “never again”
day, the “enough’s enough” day. Whatever you call it, you can
call it powerful! There is nothing so life-changing as gut-
wrenching disgust.
‘Conversely, there s nothing more pitiful than mild disgust
‘Someone says, “1 kind of think I've had it.. ." How pathetic,
how spineless. There isn't enough fuel in that kind of emotion

Decision
```
```
Mostof us need to be pushed to the wall to make decisions.
And once we reach that point, we have to deal with the con-
flicting emotions that come with making them. We have
reached a fork in the road.
Now this fork can be a two-prong, three-prong, or even
four-prong fork. No wonder that decision-making can create
Knots in our stomachs, keep us awake in the middie of the
night, or make us break out in a cold sweat
Making life-changing decisions can be likened to internal
civil war, Conflicting armies of emotions, cach with its own
arsenal of reasons, batde cach other for supremacy of our
minds. And our resulting decisions, whether bold or timid,
well thought out or impulsive, can ither set the course of action
or blind it
1 don’t have much advice to give you about decision-mak-
ing, except this: Whatever you do, don't camp at the fork in
the road. Decide. It far better to make a wrong decision
than
1o not make one at all. Each of us must confront our emotional
turmoil and sort out our feelings.

As one young entrepreneur said to me after deciding (o risk
all and start a new business: “1 have given up on the idea of
getting rid of the butterflies in my stomach. But at least now |
can make them fly in formation most of the time.
You, of course, have a tremendous tool for decision-mak-
ing, right? If you did the exercises on goal-setting (You did,
didn't you? If not, it's not too late to do them now), you have.
a long-Tange and short-range plan for your life. All you have
10 do now is decide to act by showing the proper desire.
```
```
Desire
```
```
How does one gain desire? I don’t think I can answer this
directly because there are many ways. ButIdo know two things.
about desire:
```
```
L. It comes from the inside not the outside.
```
2. It can be triggered by outside forces.

Almost anything can trigger desire. It's a matier of timing
as much as preparation. It might be a song that tugs at the
heart. It might be a memorable sermon. It might be a movie,
a conversation with a friend, a confrontation with an enemy,
ora bitter experience. Even a book such as this one can trigger
the inner mechanism that will make some people say, “I want
it now!”
‘Therefore, while searching for your “hot button” of pure,
raw desire, welcome into your life each positive experience.
Don't erect a wall to protect you from experiencing life. The
same wall that keeps out disappointment also keeps out the
sunlight of enriching experiences. So let life touch you. The
next touch could be the one that turns your life around.

Resolve
```
```
Resolve says, “1 will.” These two words are among the
most potent in the English language. I WILL.
Benjamin Disracli, the great British statesman, once said,
“Nothing can resist a human will that will stake even its ex-
istence on the extent of its purpose.” In other words, when
someone resolves 1o *“do or die,” nothing can stop him.
The mountain climber says, “1 will climb the mountain.
They've told me its too high, it's too far, it's too steep, it t00
rocky, it too difficult. But it's my mountain. I will climb it
You'll soon sce me waving from the top or you'll never see
me, because unless I reach the peak, I'm not coming back."
Who can argue with such resolve!
When confronted with such iron-willed determination, 1
can see Time, Fate, and Circumstance calling a hasty confer-
ence and deciding, *“We might as well let him have his dream.
He said he’s going to get there or dic trying.”
```
```
The bestdefinition for “resolve” I've ever heard came from
aschoolgirlin Foster City, California. As is my custom, | was
lecturing about success 10 a group of bright kids at a junior
high school. [ asked, *Who can tell me what ‘resolve’ means?”
Several hands went up, and I did get some pretty good defi-
nitions. But the last was the best. A shy girl from the back of
the room got up and said with quiet intensity, “1 think resolve
means promising yourself you will never give up.” That's it!
That's the best definition I've ever heard: PROMISE YOUR-
SELF YOU'LL NEVER GIVE UP.
Think about it! How long should a baby try to learn how
1o walk? How long would you give the average baby before
you say, “That's it, you've had your chance™? You say that's
crazy? Of course it is. Any mother in the world would say,
““My baby is going to keep trying uniil he learns how to walk!™
No wonder everyone walks.
```
```

```
The Day That Turns Your Life Around

```
There is a vital lesson in this. Ask yourself, “How longam
1 going to work to make my dreams come true?” T suggest you
answer, “As long as it takes.” That's what resolve is all about
```
```
* ACTION »
```
Knowledge fucled by emotion equals action. Action is the
last part of the formula. 1’ the ingredient that cnsures results.
Only action can cause reaction. Further, only positive action
can cause positive reaction.
Action. The whole world loves to watch those who make
things happen, and it rewards them for causing waves of pro-
ductive enterprise.
Istress this because today I see many people who are really
sold on affirmations. And yet there is a famous saying that
*“Faith without action serves no useful purpose.” How truct
1 have nothing against affirmations as a tool to create ac-
tion. Repeated to reinforce a disciplined plan, affirmations can
help create wonderful results.
But there is also a very thin line between faith and folly.
You see, affirmations without action are the beginnings of self-
delusion. And for your well-being, there is little worse than
self-delusion. It like the sales executive who comes out of a
sales meeting all revved up and says, “I'm going o be the
biggest in the business,” but then puts no disciplined thought
oraction behind her words. She might as well be walking west
Tooking for the sunrise.

```
* FOUR QUESTIONS *
```
As we approach the end of our journey together, 1 have
some questions I want you to ponder. The first is: Why should
you try? Children often ask “why" questions. And this is an

```
15t
```
```
The Day That Turns Your Life Around.
```
```
important *'why” question. I mean, why get up carly? Why
work so hard? Why read that many books? Why make that
‘many friends? Why go that far? Why carn that much? Why
give that much away?
The best answer to the “Why should you try?” question is
another question: Why not? What else are you going to do with
your life? Why not see how far you can go? Why not sce how
much you can carn, or read, or share? Why not sce what you
can become or how much you can grow? Why not? Afier all,
you'll be here until you go. Why not stay here in style?
```
```
‘The third question goes a bit further. It demands: “Why
not you?”” Some people have done the most incredible things
with a limited background. Some people do so well that they
get 10 see it all. Why not you?
Why not you watching the morning mist over the Hebrides
Tslands off Scotland? Why not you soaking up history in the
Tower of London or exploring the dark mysterics of Spain?
Why ot you having lunch in one of those charming cafes
overlooking the famous Champs Elysees in Paris? Why not
you?
There is nothing like a stroll through the Hall of Mirrors
at the palace of Versailles or gazing at the Mona Lisa in the
Louvre.
Why not you sailing a schooner in the Caribbean? Do you
Know where the most cxquisite seashells are in Miami? I can
show you.
‘Why not you shopping on Fifth Avenue in New York City,
staying at the Waldorf or the Plaza or the Carlisle, having sliced
foast goosc on a bed of apple strudel at Luchow’s? Why not
you drinking in the Arizona sunset? Why not you enjoying all
that life has to of fer, knowing that it is your reward for disci-
plined and consistent effort?
```
```
Why not you?
```
```
155
```

```
The Day That Turns Your Lie Around.
```
```
And now, my friend, here’s my last question to you: Why
not now? Why postpone a better future when so much that is
wondrous awaits your command? Get at it today. Get some
new books, make your detailed goal plan, take amillionaire
out to lunch, find new ways to increase your productivity, de-
velop a lifestyle of generosity and love, make a new effort to
believe in yourself. And get moving.
```
```
Finally, ask for God's help. Yes, I believe our future success
s up to us. But I also know that we all need spiritual suste-
nance, especially when our resolve weakens as we face
adversity.
```
‘There is a story about a man who took a rock pile and in
two years turned it into a lovely garden filled with the most
beautiful flowers. One day holy man came by. He had heard
about the garden, as its fame spread for miles around. But he
also wanted to make sure the gardener didn't forget the ultimate
Creator. So he said, “Gardener, the Lord has certainly blessed
you with a beautiful garden.” The gardener understood.
“You're right, holy man,” he said. “If it weren't for the sun-
shine, the rain, the soil, and the miracle of the seed and the
seasons, there would be no garden at all. But you should have
seen this place a couple of years ago when God had it all to
Himself.”
