one time I came up with this the four ifs that make life worthwhile. i think I got this when I was
in the Carmel library Carmel California one of my favorite places to study and
do a bit of research and I remember that day when I
put this together the four ifs that make life worthwhile speaking of
preparation here's what I said the four ifs are number one if you
learn that makes life worthwhile you've got to learn you've got to learn what
it's all about you've got to learn what's going on you learn by trying you learn by
error you learn by doing it right you learn by doing it wrong you learn from other people's experiences there's all kinds of ways to
learn never cease your quest for learning never stop learning
it makes life worthwhile if you learn then I said the second if that makes life worthwhile is if you
try you've got to do something with what you've
learned see if you can raise a garden see if you can start a business see how quickly you can get
promoted see if you can move up in the next income bracket see how much you can give away and still have plenty
left see how much you can do try it just try we're always telling the
kids right try it try it kids says "Well I'm not sure." Say "Well how are we going to know?" You got to try if I put
these two poles up put a bar across here 2 ft high say to the kids "Who can jump two
feet?" Someone says "I don't know." Say "Well how are we going to know?" You just got to back up and take
a run at it now what if you knock the bar down does that mean you can't jump two feet
no so then what do we say try it
again that's what Chop said to me keep trying he said there's more than one way up the
mountain sneak up the back if you have to keep trying keep trying so that's the
second if that makes life worthwhile if you try it over try it again try it another way but keep trying the third if
that makes life worthwhile is if you stay developing staying power that's one
of the big challenges of life some people plant in the spring and leave in the
summer they don't stay or the guy builds a foundation
right got a nice foundation then he goes off and builds another foundation and then he leaves that one
goes off builds another foundation he's got these foundations scattered all across the
country i've done my share of that not staying to finish it and put it
together and put the roof on put the last brick in place light the fireplace have a party celebrate
finishing something stay you got to stay
we asked one of my good friends Jim Cardwell in uh Phoenix one time i said "Jim what are you good at?" He said
"Starting over." Said "That's one of my better
things starting over." He's a
character asked him if he was good at any particular sport and he said "Yes skating on thin ice
okay third if that makes life worthwhile is if you stay here's the fourth one fourth if that makes life worthwhile is
if you care the incredible capacity for humans
to care but if you care if you care at all
you'll get some results if you care enough you'll get incredible results
now that wasn't too complicated a speech right just four simple ifs that make life worthwhile but it does take some
time take some research consciously get your notepad out get your journal read
the books but now then even though you don't have a speech to give just get ready for tomorrow's conversations today
get ready for next month this month get ready for next year this year always be
a day ahead and a step ahead and a year ahead in your research and your development in researching your own
feelings and life and what's going on so that no matter what conversation comes up what chance to communicate comes up
whether it's a business communication or personal communication whether it's social whatever it is you'll be more
ready for it a few months from now than perhaps you are now just because you're doing it deliberately and
consciously so that's number one have something good to say first step to good
communication here's the second step say it
well part of communication is saying it
well and there are some key points on saying it well having a good
conversation that gets your point across but also gets the job done
saying it well is a matter of repetition conscious
repetition some people say it over and over and over but they don't get any better at it but
conscious participation repetition will help you to say it better see my first seminars they they
were not that good i'll admit that but guess what i did it again with the thought in mind of
getting better i did it again with the thought in mind of getting better okay I
practiced it some more i did it some more i went over it again i went over it again and sure enough if you do it over
and over and over and over consciously with the thought of getting better guess what anybody can get
better people often wonder why I can do the evening seminar three and a half hours most of you have been there and I
don't use any notes interesting once in a while someone asked me "How can you do three
and a half hours and you don't use any notes?" And it's very simple anybody could do it guess why I'm able to do it
i've done it a few thousand times see if you do something a few
thousand times consciously sure enough you will get better and better and better so whatever
you're doing now in the way of communication the question to ask is "How long do you want it to take to get good at
it?" You say "Well I want to get good right away." Then you got to do it over and over and over and over repetition
helps you to get better so the second step to good communication is saying it well now there's some other points on
saying it well here they are one say it with sincerity and I don't know any
substitute for sincerity
almost everybody wants the feeling from someone else that you are being sincere
that you're not playing games with me that you're really disclosing to me
your true feelings your true awareness what's going on in your life in your
heart and your soul in your mind sincerity there's no substitute for
that once in a while someone asks me when the seminar is finished they say
"Look Mr own everybody's gone now just but tell me the truth." You
know that story you tell about meeting Mr shelf when you were 25 years old and uh he hired you you went to work
for him spent five years with him he taught you the principles how to turn your life around said "Now that's just a story
right that didn't really happen isn't that just a story to make all this sound
good?" Isn't that interesting that somebody would ask me if that was just a story or not or if it really
happened to be sincere it's got to be true
you just can't come up with sincerity telling an erroneous
story now you might make it sound sincere but sure enough someday it'll
come back to haunt you saying it well is saying it sincerely saying it well is saying it
accurately you don't want a lack of credibility to
creep in to your communication so you just got to be sincere tell the truth the truth is so
powerful you don't need to dress it up with [Music] fiction another part of saying it well
is saying it with brevity don't linger too long on any one
point because I got a good disclosure for you the human attention span is short
you can't linger too long on any one thing you've got to move
along so brevity brevity i used to tell long long long stories and I stretched
them out so long people forgot the beginning by the time I got to the end and now the end doesn't make much sense
right because you can't hook them both up i just drug them out too long too long people get weary you just got to
practice being brief being brief being brief short short attention span is
short the best practice on this is to practice with kids cuz their attention span is really short right and they
don't mind telling you right you start talking to the kids right and kids say "How long is this
going to take?" Right i mean right away they get the feeling you're going to take 30
seconds and you should only take 10 right i mean they get bored right away
so short short make make your stories short be brief in your illustrations if
you're going to say "Let me here's something that happened to me one time." Don't give people a feeling now that you're about to launch into a 20-minut
story just make sure you get the feeling across that you're going to be brief it isn't going to take long you're going to
get the story across and I guess part of that is our highpowered speed it up way of living especially in this country but
it is true if you want to be effective in communication you got to be
brief on any one point you can't linger long and I think I've lingered long
enough on that point next saying it well is saying it
with style now part of style is your personal
style and this involves a whole lot of things it can involve gestures it can involve facial
expressions um you talk with your eyes you know you speak with your facial
expressions as well as with your words uh some people talk more with their
hands that's part of your style gestures all of that now here's
the key on this is to develop your own style
however be a student of style first have something good to say
second is to say it well consciously say it well practice saying it
well get to where the words come more clearly more
freely things you used to stumble over when you talked a year ago you just
correct that you just correct it and correct it so that now it flows better shorten the stories used to be long now
they're shorter you just do all that consciously consciously so that you get better and better at it saying it well
okay here's the third step to good communication and this is so important
read the effect you're
having when you communicate see that's just
major study your audience whoever your audience may be if it's one of your children you just study what's happening
to them while you're talking right look in their eyes look in their face analyze what's going on between you
and whoever you're talking to another person whether it's a business conversation or a social conversation
you've got to be keenly aware of what's happening to whoever you're communicating
with now a real challenge is communicating uh with an audience
we had about 1,200 people the other night in Orange County right and I've got to make sure that everybody from down here down in front way in the back
how to gather up a thousand people's attention right for the 3 and 1/2 hour
period now that's a real challenge i didn't used to be that good at it in
fact when I first started lecturing I was hardly aware of my audience i was so absorbed in my notes and my material i
guess what they could have all got up and left and I would have never known it i wouldn't have missed him i'd have
just kept right on talking right because I was so absorbed in the material i was so absorbed in trying to say it right
and do it right that I was not aware of what was going on with my audience but
you've got to read the effect you're having for really effective communication now if it's just an
informal communication situation you can just ask the question "Do you read me?"
Right does it make sense did I say it well and you'll get
this feedback right so you can actually start checking how you're doing with somebody if it's informal you can just
ask okay now what you've also got to learn to do
is read the some of the subtle things that are going on with whoever you're talking to because especially humans or
especially adults you know when we get a little older we have these tricky ways of of
looking like we're interested when we're really not and if you want to be a good communicator you just got to pick up
some of those signals now part of it you can pick up by what we call body language some
people just sort of quickly disclose their feelings about whether or not you're effective or it's coming across
and they just sort of relay to you by their what we call
body language it's kind of a new study i haven't studied that much about it but there is a book called How to
Read a Person Like a Book how to read a person like a
book by Nermberg
you just might make a little study on that now don't get too involved in it because sometimes you can so watch somebody in the way they blink their
eyes and you know you're looking at their ears and looking at their hair and you just now you get too carried away
and trying to figure out you know all about them but you can get some indication but here's what'll here's
what'll play you good no matter what it's called just pure common sense you
just look at somebody you can kind of tell if somebody just folds their arms and they tuck their head down like this
sure enough you've probably got some more selling to do i mean you got to pour it on or maybe you should change
the subject or maybe you should quit right you just just kind of analyze you
know what's going on here right you Some things you just fairly obvious you know if a guy's leaning
toward the door like this it's probably a sign right and you say "Oh I got it." Right
clear i've got a good word for the common sense approach and it goes like this let the obvious be your best
teacher whatever you do don't ignore the obvious you know sometimes we say "Oh it
couldn't be." Yes it probably
is but adults especially is sometimes this is a bit tricky
people smile nod their head like this and they got you shut off and you just
don't know okay because in good communication you
cannot mistake courtesy for interest sometimes people will be
courteous but that doesn't mean they're interested now if you mistake their courtesy for their interest now see you've lost
the the hold on good communication also you can also develop
um a sense of picking up
signals i think the women probably have it over on the men when it comes to this sort of sixth sense of being able to
tell no matter what the situation looks like women have this uncanny
gift i guess men can develop it but women already have it you know the antenna is out i mean
they pick up signals nobody else can pick up i mean the men don't have a chance i think part of it is because
until the industrialized society came uh women were primarily the protectors the
man was the provider right he was gone he was out there getting the game or whatever and
the woman was the protector so I think the woman has devised these
incredible sensitivities to danger and what's going on what's happening i
they're uncanning even the Bible says there's
sheep and there's the shepherd and then there's the
wolves that's what it says life is kind of like that shepherd and sheep and
wolves it says also some wolves are so clever they've learned to dress up like
sheep and talk like sheep i guess that's what it says some are
wolves in what sheep's clothes sheep's clothes now see you got to be clever
huh the man says "Well looks like a sheep talks like a sheep." Woman says "Ain't no sheep i mean take my word for
it." But that's that long developed instinct I guess right in the middle of
the night she says "Wake up wake up something isn't right out there he says "Uhuh right i mean he's gone." Right she says "No no no something something."
Right she just she has this uncanny sense so that's part of you know being
able to read is uh picking up mr schae called it
signals says we all throw off signals vibrations you know I don't understand
all I know about that but have you heard the expression "A dog can tell whether or not you're afraid of
him?" Guess that's true we throw off a certain kind of signal and they just animals right they just pick it up they
pick it up they know and you can't fake them out right you can say "I'm not afraid of you." Dog says "Who are you kidding?" Right i mean
come on okay being able to read that's so
important reading your audience how you're doing should you
speed up should you slow down should you change the subject should you be a little stronger just be more aware of
whoever you're talking to right look a little more intently at somebody try to
pick up what's happening between you and the audience or the person or the
child or the business partner you can't believe how it will affect your ability
to communicate if you'll practice this part of picking up what's happening between you and someone else now here's
number four then we're going to take our first break the fourth step to good
communication is
intensity strong feelings here's what changes the whole
effectiveness of good communication strong
feelings in affecting other people with words here's a key breakdown to keep in mind and it
goes like this to affect other people with words it's 20% what you
know and it's 80% how you
feel feelings and emotions changes the whole outcome of
communication intensity words loaded with
emotion have the best
effect words might be like a little straight pin right when a guy buys a
shirt right it's got all these little pins in it right where they pinned all it together so you start pulling out all
these straight pins what if I took one of those straight pins and uh I threw it at you this
little straight pin and it reached you hit you in the face or hit you in the arm hand somewhere right you'd feel it
if I threw that little straight pin at you what if I took that straight pin and wired it to the end of an iron
bar about that long right and I let you have it with that see I could drive that pin right
through your heart right now the pin is the
words and the iron bar is the emotions the feelings the
awareness the uniqueness of all of that mysterious stuff that humans are made of
if you will learn to put more of you into what you say put more feelings more
awareness more uniqueness strength of character conviction strong feelings whatever that
is just be more aware of putting more of you into whatever you say that's that iron bar that drives what you say to the
heart to the mind and gets the job done
words loaded with emotion now you must also learn to measure your
emotions okay you don't want a major outburst for a minor
point learn to measure it okay some conversations or some points may need
right just a mild blend of emotional feelings and
then another point may need a strong one but you got to learn to measure that okay not too much for something
minor you don't want to shoot a cannon at a rabbit right it's effective but you got
no more rabbit so learn to measure your emotions
now here's something important where does emotion come
from where do our feelings come from here's where they come from the emotions that can really help in all of your
future conversations communication it's the blend of all of your
experiences and how they have affected you the blend of all of your experiences
and how they have affected
you that's creates now your emotional content creates your emotional vitality
and worth so that's part of the getting
ready experience on the emotional side be aware of your feelings be aware of your
emotions and as that experience grows now when you get ready to talk you've got the blend of
knowledge and the blend of feelings to put into your
conversation and that's what creates the
power now I have one more point and we'll take our break
it says "Don't forget to say it." Part of communication is simply
being aware that more often than not things need to be
said it's pretty easy to take for granted especially to the people that are close around us that they already
know how we feel but you got to keep expressing how you feel here's a good
phrase actions are no substitute for
words now we've used the other phrase right that words are no substitute for action and that's
true just talk talk talk talk talk and not acting see that's not good but
here's what else is not good all of the action and no talk make sure that the words accompany
the action don't fail to say it
probably one of the greatest difficulties in married life is
this breakdown in communication not clearing the air often enough not keeping this open dialogue
going constantly one thing I found out take
nothing for granted say "Well surely they understand." Well just explain it one
more time just say it one more time don't take a chance that whether they know it or not bring up the subject
again make sure it's clear it's too easy to let it slide and
not make it
clear especially the people around you say how often do you have to tell
the people that you love that you love them how often answer often
often we all need reassurance we all need the it to be clear and pointed so
that we know there are some things you just don't let
go and there are some actions that will only say certain things they won't say at all you can give somebody flowers but
flowers won't do all the talking flowers say you remembered
that's about That's probably what flowers say but flowers don't say "You do incredible
things to me nobody affects me like you do." Now see flowers will talk but they won't say
that that's the card you've got to put along with the flowers let the flower say whatever they can say but then don't
fail to put the other words with it because the words are so important
judy gave me this watch back when I had a birthday in 1972
I believe it was and it was a neat watch lool tray if
all goes wrong I can cash the watch in and live for a while right i mean Judy was always doing things like that fabulous watch neat neat gift for my
birthday but see better than the watch was what she wrote on the back
i appreciated the watch but the words were better than the watch on the back she had inscribed "My
love for all time." Your Judy September
1972 see the watch was neat but the words she could have put the words on a Mickey Mouse watch
pardon me Walt i didn't mean to downgrade your mouse but but see the words were what was
really important so I'm saying let actions speak but make sure
the actions don't substitute for the words make sure you say
it and if you'll make sure you'll say it you'll get better at it you'll get the
practice you'll learn to put more feelings in it you'll learn to say it well say it
better and this whole process of communication for you if you don't treat any of it casually will start to grow
and you will be even startled in the next few weeks the next few months at what happens as a result of your future
conversations if you become more aware of these things that we have just talked about
sensitivity fascination interest working knowledge having something good to say
saying it well reading the effect you're having and the intensity of strong
feelings okay our next subject under communication is how to make a presentation
and whether it's a presentation to a child or a presentation to a business
client or a sales presentation or whatever kind of presentation we're
all making presentations all day long every day
business social personal whatever i have four parts to the
presentation for you to uh
consider here's the first one identification one of the most important
parts of the presentation processes identification identification
is for a new person that you haven't met before it's getting acquainted it's breaking the ice
it's building a bridge between you and someone else establishing contact
uh getting somebody's attention so it's a very important part of the presentation
process sometimes those first few seconds sometimes that first minute is
just so important to establishing rapport establishing contact
somebody once said "You never have a second chance to make a first
impression." So sometimes how those opening seconds go is very
important but that's identification getting
acquainted some people find this easy some people find it more difficult what we're doing is you know pointing it out
so that you can start working on it deliberately instead of haphazardly or
instead of just letting it go wondering why things aren't going well we just pick it as a part of the presentation so
you can go to work on it identification in identifying with
someone one of the best ways is to pick something you have in common to get the conversation started
with somebody mentioned during the break they attended this leadership seminar up at the ranch
uh what you were up there three or four years ago and everybody got acquainted up there real easy and the reason is
because when you met somebody new you would say hi how are you did you get as lost as I did trying to find this
place and it just everybody says yeah I got lost too and that immediately starts
this you know little more friendly process of getting acquainted simply because you had a recent experience that
uh you could talk about so identification is trying to find something you have in common with
someone else you want something that makes you real something that makes you
uh a person that someone would desire to talk
to in the identification process we use this little mental phrase we want
somebody to say "Me
too." Say "Well here's what happened to me." Somebody says "Well me too i got lost." They say "Well me too." Here's
how I felt someone says "I understand how that feels." Me too here's a reaction you don't want the
reaction called "So what?"
Now usually one of the problems in people's trying to identify is they try
to impress versus express mr schae gave me a little
counsel on this don't try to impress he said rather learn to
express express will get you more metos impressing will get you more so
whats see so what puts up the barrier instead of building a bridge it blocks this flow of
communication usually when we introduce somebody the introduction is usually full of so
whats one of the biggest challenges I have in doing seminars is to overcome my
introduction usually an introduction you know you have to give your list of credits but when somebody gets through
with the he's president of this and vice president of this and he's got several companies corporations does business
around the world those are pretty well so whats and I guess we you know we consider it sort of standard the so
whats so one of the first things I do when I come up on the platform and you know I get the polite applause and I
understand it's polite applause it's just part of the routine right that we go through if you take that serious you're in trouble
right but you know you get the polite applause so I walk up after all these credits right and I can tell the people
are you know saying you know you know who is this guy and is he really all he's cracked up to be right you can just
feel all this going on in the audience so I usually try to just you know break that down just as quickly as I can by
saying something like uh I appreciate the warm welcome did you hear what the cow said to the farmer on a cold winter
morning right thanks for the warm hand right and it goes over about like it did
here right i mean it just sort of you know hangs out there and that's to kind of let people
know that you know we're not interested in the chairman title or the president's title we're here to just you know talk
person to person and part of that is just an attempt to identify to let everybody know you're not up there to
talk down at them you're not there to try to impress them with your success or anything else we're there to really
share ideas but that's always a challenge and every person and every
audience is a brand new challenge every time you talk with somebody it's a brand new challenge to identify now here's
what you must must do with someone who you already know reidentify you don't get this
identification process once when you get to know somebody and then it's it's forever over you must constantly
reidentify no matter how long you've known somebody they still want to know how what are you feeling and what's
going on with you and what are you thinking and right everybody wants to know that even if we've been around
somebody for a long time when you meet somebody that's why we use those expressions if we've known somebody for
years if we see them again we say how are you and how are you doing that's to get this thing going this identification process going between us and someone
else now in the identification process make sure if you tell those stories
about yourself in identifying make sure that they're accurate
stories part of my identification I sprinkle throughout the whole evening seminar my little story about the
meeting the little girl scout selling me girl scout cookies right that's just a little story to try to keep identifying
with my audience to keep them on my side right that's that's identification
story right she gives me this unique presentation asked me if I want to buy and I wanted to but I didn't have
$2 now see I can almost hear everybody out in the audience say "I know what that's like." I've been caught without any
money i know how embarrassing that is see that's an identification story somebody says "I know how that feels."
And I say "To this day I can remember the pain." Somebody says "I've had some of that pain too i know what that's like
all of that is identification identification so you have to reidentify
if you're talking with somebody over any length of time you just reidentify little stories things that's happened to
you so go back over your life and pick out the things that will identify with
people now you've got the challenge of also identifying with a variety of people from different backgrounds and
different uh businesses than your own and you just learn to do that different
age groups part of it is just being more
aware of what's going on in the world so that you can just intelligently talk about some things with people from
almost any walk of life okay jesus the master teacher was
probably one of the great identifiers of all time he had this incredible knack of talking
to somebody with language that they understood what he was saying one day he said to those around
him "Today I'm going to teach you how to fish." Guess who he was talking to a
bunch of fishermen he said "Gentlemen today we're going to have some lessons on how to fish only i don't want to
teach you how to fish for fish cuz you already know how to do that
what I want to do is to teach you how to fish for
people now see he couldn't have chosen a better identification he didn't say "I'm going
to teach you how to recruit." I mean what do they know from recruiting no no he said "I'm going to
teach you how to fish." Now when you're talking to fishermen that's clever right you don't
say recruit when you're talking to fishermen you say fish see that's
incredible you just learn when you talk fishermanmen talk a little fish talk right if you talk to lawyers just talk a
little lawyer talk i mean you just learn how right go sit in the courtroom and you
know learn a little lawyer talk if you're going to talk to lawyers or get in trouble and uh go to
court right and sit on the witness stand and whatever just so that you can learn to identify say "I've been through it i
know it." And analyze who you're talking to and see if you can't pick out certain
ways to identify now of course there's some stories that are common to us all and sometimes it doesn't take much of a
story to
identify here's a good one how to identify with kids let me give you some keys first
read all their books one of the best ways to identify
with kids is read all their books if you got a 12-year-old you just read all their books so that you know them
forwards and backwards so you can use those books as a means of identification and stories say remember that story when
when when kids says did you read that book i read them all i know all those stories and
remember when and you can use a thousand illustrations from those books that you've read to get a point across to get
something across it's a means of identification read their books then when you get ready to talk you got
something in common they've read the book you've read the book and it's loaded probably with illustrations and
points and ideas and and human life stories of disappointment and and success and failure all of that the way
to identify is find out what someone else is interested in find out who they are how old they are what they do what's
going on and see if in your reservoir of experience and awareness you can't find something that will identify and cause
this person to say "Me too i understand that." and you've got them coming your
way then also a way to identify with kids is to remember when you were a
kid see I don't have any problem talking to 12-year-olds cuz I remember every day about being
12 i remember all those experiences in detail the highs the lows the exciting
times the desperate times when I thought the world was coming to an end and when
I was riding on top i remember all those feelings at
12 did you ever get chosen last that ever happened to
you they're choosing up sides right so I'll take you i'll take you i'll take you i'll take you and you're standard like this
[Laughter]
see all you got to do is go back over go back over search around in your life you can find a thousand ways to identify
with all kinds of people from your own life experiences okay you don't have to go
anywhere else except to your own life to come up with all kinds of ways to identify with anybody but here's what
you got to do you got to do it consciously consciously deliberately what can I pick
what can I think of that will help this conversation that will get my idea across who am I talking to oh yes here's
what I'll use right your mind just like a computer starts picking up all these things this is why it's so important to
keep a journal and when you think of a life experience and say "Oh I could use that life experience in in a variety of
ways." You put that life experience in your journal you go over it you you think about it then when you get ready
to talk it's instant recall you'll you you'll remember it and you can't believe what you can do with people from all
walks of life business social personal if you will learn the identification process do it deliberately pick out
things that you have in common feelings you have in common with everybody okay
identification and then pick up stories from all kinds of life situations that
are similar to yours somebody had a feeling of disappointment you say "I know what that's like but I'm going to
use that story to illustrate disappointment." Just be aware the
movies you attend and the books you read and the stories you hear be a gatherer of life's experiences so that you can
use them all for points of reference and points of identification
when a teenager watches the movie Gone with the Wind they see one kind of movie when you're in your 20s and 30s and you
see Gone with the Wind you see a different kind of movie right when you get along into your 40s 50s sure enough
it's a different kind of movie cuz now you're reading between the lines now you're sensing what the real tragedy was
what the complications of life were it's altogether different at 40 than it is at
14 same movie only now you're seeing it you're picking up all the different
parts of the story and the feelings of the story it's getting to you but that's
part of the identification process just be more aware of what you see and what you read and what's happening to you so
that you say "Oh there's something I could use there's something I could use i'll use that the next time I talk to people like this I'll tell them this
i'll tell them this i'll use this story." That's part of the identification process building this bridge
